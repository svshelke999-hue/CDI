    "summary": "72-year-old female with cuff tear arthropathy of the right shoulder underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The procedure was performed using a deltopectoral approach with subscapularis release, humeral head resection, glenoid baseplate placement with screws, and humeral component insertion. No complications were reported, and the patient was placed in an abduction pillow with non-weight-bearing instructions for the upper extremity."

The interval between the deltoid and pectoralis major was developed. The subscapularis was identified and released for exposure of the glenohumeral joint.\n\nUpon entering the joint, significant [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: specific intraoperative findings regarding rotator cuff and articular surfaces] were noted, confirming the preoperative diagnosis of cuff tear arthropathy.\n\nThe humeral head was resected at the anatomic neck using an oscillating saw. The humeral canal was then prepared with sequential reamers to [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: specific reamer size] mm. The glenoid was exposed, and [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: specific details of glenoid preparation] was performed.\n\nThe glenoid baseplate was secured with [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: number and size of screws] screws, achieving excellent fixation. The [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: size] mm glenosphere was then impacted onto the baseplate.\n\nThe humeral component was inserted with [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: details of cement usage if applicable].

The final implants were inserted, and the subscapularis was repaired using [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: specific repair technique and suture type].\n\nThe wound was copiously irrigated and closed in layers.
