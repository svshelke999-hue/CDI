Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a full-thickness supraspinatus tear and superior labral instability from 11 to 1 o'clock position. Treatment included arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using four anchors and labral repair with two knotless anchors. Patient was discharged in stable condition with an arm immobilizer and outpatient pain management plan."

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, left shoulder\n2. Arthroscopic labral repair, left shoulder\n\nINDICATIONS:\n45-year-old female with progressive shoulder pain and weakness. Clinical exam and imaging suggested combined rotator cuff and superior labral pathology after a workplace fall.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Symptomatic rotator cuff tear, left shoulder\n2. Superior labral tear, left shoulder\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nSame as above.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and positioned in modified beach chair. After routine preparation and draping, standard posterior viewing portal was established with an anterior working portal.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC ARTHROSCOPY:\nGlobal inspection revealed fraying of the superior labrum with instability at the 11 to 1 o'clock position. A full-thickness tear involving the supraspinatus was visualized. Biceps anchor appeared intact.\n\nLABRAL REPAIR:\nUnstable labral tissue was lightly debrided. Knotless anchors were used to reapproximate the labrum to the glenoid rim with stable fixation.\n\nROTATOR CUFF REPAIR:\nAttention was directed to the supraspinatus tear. The footprint was cleared of soft tissue and prepared for repair. Two medial row anchors were placed with lateral row fixation to restore footprint coverage.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE PLAN:\nArm immobilizer applied in the operating room. Outpatient pain regimen and sling instructions provided. Physical therapy protocol to be determined at first postoperative visit.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Not documented.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nDRAINS: None.\n\nIMPLANTS:\nTwo knotless labral anchors and four rotator cuff anchors placed.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nTransferred to PACU in stable condition.\n\n\n",
