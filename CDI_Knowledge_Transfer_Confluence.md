## Page 1: Core CDI Concepts and Documentation Principles

### 1. Understanding Pre-Operative vs. Operative Documentation

#### Pre-Operative Diagnosis vs. Operative Findings
- **Pre-operative diagnosis** represents the reason for surgery based on initial evaluation (e.g., "Posterior labral tear")
- **Operative findings** reflect what was discovered during the actual surgery (e.g., "Anterior, posterior, and posteroinferior labral tears")
- Additional procedures may be identified during surgery that were not planned pre-operatively

#### Coding from Procedure Description
- **Critical Principle:** Coders and systems must determine procedures from the **Description of Procedure** section, NOT from headers or indications
- The procedure performed section may list planned procedures, but actual procedures performed are documented in the body/narrative description
- Always refer to the detailed operative description for accurate coding

### 2. Diagnostic vs. Therapeutic Procedures

#### Fundamental Coding Rule
When a **therapeutic procedure** is performed, the **diagnostic procedure is automatically included** and should NOT be coded separately.

**Example - Arthroscopy:**
- **29805** = Diagnostic arthroscopy (viewing only)
- **29807** = Therapeutic arthroscopy with SLAP lesion repair
- **If repair is performed → Code 29807 ONLY (29805 is included)**

**General Scope Rule:**
This principle applies to ALL scopes:
- Arthroscopy
- Laparoscopy
- Endoscopy
- Colonoscopy
- Cystoscopy
- Any procedure with diagnostic and therapeutic variants

**Analogous Example - Endoscopy:**
- Diagnostic endoscopy: Insert scope, view stomach only
- Therapeutic endoscopy: Insert scope, view stomach AND remove foreign body
- If foreign body is removed → Code therapeutic endoscopy only (diagnostic is bundled)

**Insurance Impact:**
- Coding both diagnostic and therapeutic when only therapeutic was performed will result in claim rejection
- This is a standard guideline across all scopes in CPT coding

### 3. Documentation Gaps in Operative Notes

#### Common Missing Elements
Operative notes alone cannot provide complete documentation. Typical gaps include:

**Time-Based Information:**
- Duration of symptoms (months/years)
- Duration of conservative treatment (minimum 3 months required)
- Duration of functional limitations (minimum 6 months required)

**Pre-Operative Management:**
- Physical therapy history (duration, frequency)
- Medications (types, dosages, duration)
- Injections (type, location, date)
- Conservative treatment attempts

**Physical Examination Details:**
- Range of motion testing
- Impingement tests (Hawkins, Neer, etc.)
- Strength testing
- Comparison to contralateral side

**Anesthesia Details:**
- Type of anesthesia (general, local, spinal, epidural, sedation)
- Note: Detailed anesthesia documentation exists in separate anesthesia records

**Post-Operative Instructions:**
- Immobilization duration
- Activity restrictions
- Follow-up protocols
- Note: Typically documented in discharge notes or nursing notes, not operative notes

### 4. Complete Documentation Requirement for CDI

#### CDI Cannot Be Performed on Operative Notes Alone
**Critical Insight:** CDI requires complete patient health record, not just surgical/operative notes.

#### Required Documentation Components

**Pre-Operative Documents:**
- Consultation notes (initial evaluation)
- History and physical examination
- Conservative treatment documentation
- Imaging studies and reports
- Pre-operative evaluation notes

**Operative Documents:**
- Operative notes (procedure performed)
- Anesthesia records (separate from operative notes)

**Post-Operative Documents:**
- Daily physician notes (progress notes)
- Nursing notes (medication administration, patient care)
- Pathology reports (if applicable)
- Radiology reports (if applicable)
- Discharge summary

**Why Complete Documentation Matters:**
- Pre-operative consultation notes contain: time frames, conservative treatment history, physical examination details
- Nursing notes contain: post-operative care instructions, medication timing
- Pathology/radiology reports provide: diagnostic confirmation and severity
- Missing documentation creates gaps that CDI systems cannot fill retrospectively

**System Requirements:**
- Access to complete Electronic Health Record (EHR) system
- OR provider must upload complete patient health record
- Cannot ask physicians to rewrite operative notes with information already in other documents

### 5. CMS and CPT Guidelines vs. Payer-Specific Guidelines

#### General Guidelines for CDI
- **CDI follows general CMS and CPT coding guidelines**, not payer-specific guidelines
- Payer-specific guidelines apply **after** CDI is complete, during the coding and submission phase
- Coders are responsible for verifying payer coverage before submission

#### Guideline Application Flow
1. **CDI Phase:** Apply general CMS/CPT guidelines to improve documentation completeness
2. **Coding Phase:** Apply payer-specific guidelines to determine code acceptability
3. **Submission Phase:** Codes are submitted based on what was actually performed

#### Important Limitations
- **Cannot modify documentation** based on payer coverage
- If a procedure was performed, it must be documented accurately
- If payer doesn't cover the procedure, cost goes to patient (out-of-pocket)
- Physicians cannot be asked to remove or modify procedures based on insurance coverage

**Example Scenario:**
- Procedure: Therapeutic arthroscopy (CPT 29807)
- Insurance: Anthem doesn't cover this procedure
- **Correct Approach:** Document as performed, code correctly, patient pays out-of-pocket
- **Incorrect Approach:** Ask physician to change documentation or remove procedure

**Sources:**
- CMS website for CMS guidelines
- CPT coding guidelines (American Medical Association)
- Specialty-specific guidelines may exist but general guidelines take precedence for CDI

### 6. CDI Timing: When Does CDI Occur?

#### CDI is Primarily for Denial Cases
**Key Principle:** CDI typically occurs **AFTER coding and submission**, when claims are denied.

**Why After Submission?**
- Cannot predict which CPT codes will be rejected before submission
- Payer-specific limitations are unknown until denial occurs
- Historical claim data (previous submissions, frequency limits) is not available until denial

**Denial Scenarios:**
1. **Frequency Limits:** Some CPT codes have submission limits (e.g., 2-3 times per year)
2. **Payer Policy Exclusions:** Certain procedures not covered by specific payers
3. **Missing Documentation:** Insufficient information to support medical necessity
4. **Prior Authorization Issues:** Additional procedures performed without pre-authorization

**Pre-Authorization Example:**
- Patient receives pre-authorization for cesarean section only
- During surgery, physician also performs tubal ligation (not pre-authorized)
- If ligation is denied:
  - Provider must justify why ligation was performed
  - Emergency vs. elective determination required
  - Documentation must support medical necessity
- **Note:** This justification occurs during denial/appeal, not during initial CDI

**Emergency vs. Elective Procedures:**
- Emergency procedures may have different documentation requirements
- Elective procedures require stronger justification
- These distinctions typically arise during denial/appeal, not initial CDI

**Rare Exception Cases:**
- Less than 5% of cases require justification for unplanned procedures
- These are handled during denial/appeal phase
- Cannot predict or prevent these during initial CDI

### 7. Inpatient vs. Outpatient Documentation

#### Complete Inpatient Record Structure
For inpatients (1-2 day stays), documentation includes:

**Before Surgery:**
- Pre-admission records
- Consultation notes
- Pre-operative evaluation

**Day of Surgery:**
- Operative notes
- Anesthesia records
- Recovery/observation notes

**After Surgery:**
- Daily physician progress notes
- Nursing notes (multiple times per day)
- Post-operative care documentation

**Advantage of Complete Record:**
- All documentation gaps can be filled automatically
- Pre-operative consultation provides missing time frames and treatment history
- Post-operative notes provide missing care instructions and outcomes
- Pathology/radiology reports provide diagnostic confirmation

### 8. Key Takeaways and Best Practices

#### Documentation Location Reference

| Information Type | Where to Find It |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Time frames, conservative treatment | Consultation notes, pre-operative evaluation |
| Physical examination details | Consultation notes, pre-operative evaluation |
| Hand dominance, occupation | Consultation notes (rarely in operative notes) |
| Anesthesia type | Anesthesia records, operative notes (brief) |
| Detailed anesthesia info | Separate anesthesia documentation |
| Post-operative instructions | Discharge notes, nursing notes |
| Medication administration | Nursing notes |
| Pathology results | Pathology reports |
| Imaging findings | Radiology reports |

#### System Implementation Recommendations

1. **Request Complete Records:** Always request full patient health record, not just operative notes
2. **Integrate with EHR:** Work with hospitals to get EHR access for comprehensive documentation
3. **Educate Providers:** Explain that CDI works best with complete records
4. **Focus on Completeness:** CDI goal is documentation completeness, not payer-specific optimization
5. **Respect Documentation Integrity:** Never ask providers to modify actual procedures performed

#### CDI Success Factors

✅ **Complete patient health record available**  
✅ **Access to pre-operative and post-operative documentation**  
✅ **Integration with hospital EHR systems**  
✅ **General CMS/CPT guideline adherence**  
✅ **Focus on documentation completeness, not payer optimization**

## Summary

This knowledge transfer session emphasized that **Clinical Documentation Improvement requires complete patient health records**, not just operative notes. The system must understand where different types of information are located within medical documentation and follow general CMS/CPT guidelines rather than payer-specific requirements during the CDI phase. CDI primarily serves denial cases and focuses on ensuring documentation completeness and accuracy based on procedures actually performed.
