    "full_text": "The word \"with\" or \"in\" should be interpreted to mean \"associated with\" or \"due to\" when it appears in a code title, the Alphabetic Index (either under a main term or subterm), or an instructional note in the Tabular List. The classification presumes a causal relationship between the two conditions linked by these terms in the Alphabetic Index or Tabular List. These conditions should be coded as related even in the absence of provider documentation explicitly linking them, unless the documentation clearly states the conditions are unrelated or when another guideline exists that specifically requires a documented linkage between two conditions (e.g., sepsis guideline for \"acute organ dysfunction that is not clearly associated with the sepsis\"). For conditions not specifically linked by these relational terms in the classification or when a guideline requires that a linkage between two conditions be explicitly documented, provider documentation must link the conditions in order to code them as related. The word \"with\" in the Alphabetic Index is sequenced immediately following the main term or subterm, not in alphabetical order. (Evidence: pg no: 11, L53-L59)",
