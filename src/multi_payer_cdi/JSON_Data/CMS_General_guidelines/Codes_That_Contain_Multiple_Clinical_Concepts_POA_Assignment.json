Assign 'Y' if all of the clinical concepts included in the code were present on admission (e.g., duodenal ulcer that perforates prior to admission). For infection codes that include the causal organism, assign 'Y' if the infection (or signs of the infection) were present on admission, even though the culture results may not be known until after admission (e.g., patient is admitted with pneumonia and the provider documents Pseudomonas as the causal organism a few days later).
