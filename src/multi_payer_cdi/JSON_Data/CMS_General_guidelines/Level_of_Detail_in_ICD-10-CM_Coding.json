Codes with three characters are included in ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of codes that may be further subdivided by the use of fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh characters to provide greater specificity. Use of full number of characters required for a code. A three-character code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. A code is invalid if it has not been coded to the full number of characters required for that code, including the 7th character, if applicable. Highest level of specificity. Code to the highest level of specificity when supported by the medical record documentation. (Evidence: pg no: 113, L54-L64)",
