If it is not clear whether the injury was a direct result of the hurricane, assume the injury is due to the hurricane and assign code X37.0-, Hurricane, as well as any other applicable external cause of morbidity codes. In addition to code X37.0-, Hurricane, other possible applicable external cause of morbidity codes include: X30-, Exposure to excessive natural heat; X31-, Exposure to excessive natural cold; X38-, Flood.
