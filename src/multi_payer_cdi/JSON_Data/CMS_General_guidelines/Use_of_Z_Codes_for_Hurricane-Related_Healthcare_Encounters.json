    "full_text": "Z codes (other reasons for healthcare encounters) may be assigned as appropriate to further explain the reasons for presenting for healthcare services, including transfers between healthcare facilities, or provide additional information relevant to a patient encounter. The ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting identify which codes maybe assigned as principal or first-listed diagnosis only, secondary diagnosis only, or principal/first-listed or secondary (depending on the circumstances). Possible applicable Z codes include: Z59.0-, Homelessness; Z59.1, Inadequate housing; Z59.5, Extreme poverty; Z75.1, Person awaiting admission to adequate facility elsewhere; Z75.3, Unavailability and inaccessibility of health-care facilities; Z75.4, Unavailability and inaccessibility of other helping agencies; Z76.2, Encounter for health supervision and care of other healthy infant and child; Z99.12, Encounter for respirator [ventilator] dependence during power failure. The external cause of morbidity codes and the Z codes listed above are not an all-inclusive list. Other codes may be applicable to the encounter based upon the documentation. Assign as many codes as necessary to fully explain each healthcare encounter. Since patient history information may be very limited, use any available documentation to assign the appropriate external cause of morbidity and Z codes. (Evidence: pg no: 19-20, L18-L34)",
