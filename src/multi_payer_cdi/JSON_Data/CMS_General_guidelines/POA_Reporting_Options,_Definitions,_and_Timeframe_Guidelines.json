    "full_text": "Reporting Options: Y – Yes, N – No, U – Unknown, W – Clinically undetermined, Unreported/Not used – (Exempt from POA reporting). Reporting Definitions: Y = present at the time of inpatient admission, N = not present at the time of inpatient admission, U = documentation is insufficient to determine if condition is present on admission, W = provider is unable to clinically determine whether condition was present on admission or not. Timeframe for POA Identification and Documentation: There is no required timeframe as to when a provider (per the definition of \"provider\" used in these guidelines) must identify or document a condition to be present on admission. In some clinical situations, it may not be possible for a provider to make a definitive diagnosis (or a condition may not be recognized or reported by the patient) for a period of time after admission. In some cases, it may be several days before the provider arrives at a definitive diagnosis. This does not mean that the condition was not present on admission. Determination of whether the condition was present on admission or not will be based on the applicable POA guideline as identified in this document, or on the provider's best clinical judgment. If at the time of code assignment the documentation is unclear as to whether a condition was present on admission or not, it is appropriate to query the provider for clarification.
