    "full_text": "Aftercare visit codes cover situations when the initial treatment of a disease has been performed and the patient requires continued care during the healing or recovery phase, or for the long-term consequences of the disease. The aftercare Z code should not be used if treatment is directed at a current, acute disease. The diagnosis code is to be used in these cases. The aftercare Z codes should also not be used for aftercare for injuries. For aftercare of an injury, assign the acute injury code with the appropriate 7th character (for subsequent encounter). The aftercare codes are generally first listed to explain the specific reason for the encounter. An aftercare code may be reported as an additional code when a specific type of aftercare is provided in addition to the reason for the encounter. An example of this would be the closure of a colostomy during an encounter for treatment of another condition. Aftercare codes should be used in conjunction with other aftercare codes or diagnosis codes to provide better detail on the specifics of an aftercare encounter visit, unless otherwise directed by the classification. The sequencing of multiple aftercare codes depends on the circumstances of the encounter. Certain aftercare Z code categories need a secondary diagnosis code to describe the resolving condition or sequelae. For others, the condition is included in the code title. Additional Z code aftercare category terms include fitting and adjustment, and attention to artificial openings. Status Z codes may be used with aftercare Z codes to indicate the nature of the aftercare. (Evidence: pg no: 100, L14-L32)",
