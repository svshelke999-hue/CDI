Excludes1 - A type 1 Excludes note is a pure excludes note. It means 'NOT CODED HERE!' An Excludes1 note indicates that the code excluded should never be used at the same time as the code above the Excludes1 note. An Excludes1 is used when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form versus an acquired form of the same condition. (Evidence: pg no: 9, L78-L82)",
