    "full_text": "A type 1 Excludes note is a pure excludes note. It means \"NOT CODED HERE!\" An Excludes1 note indicates that the code excluded should never be used at the same time as the code above the Excludes1 note. An Excludes1 is used when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form versus an acquired form of the same condition. An exception to the Excludes1 definition is the circumstance when the two conditions are unrelated to each other. If it is not clear whether the two conditions involving an Excludes1 note are related or not, query the provider. (Evidence: pg no: 10, L23-L29)",
