    "full_text": "A type 2 Excludes note represents \"Not included here.\" An excludes2 note indicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition represented by the code, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. When an Excludes2 note appears under a code, it is acceptable to use both the code and the excluded code together, when appropriate. (Evidence: pg no: 10, L30-L31)",
