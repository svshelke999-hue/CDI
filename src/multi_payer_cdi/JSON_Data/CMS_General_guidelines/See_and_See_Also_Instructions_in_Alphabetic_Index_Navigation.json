    "full_text": "The \"see\" instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index indicates that another term should be referenced. It is necessary to go to the main term referenced with the \"see\" note to locate the correct code. A \"see also\" instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index instructs that there is another main term that may also be referenced that may provide additional Alphabetic Index entries that may be useful. It is not necessary to follow the \"see also\" note when the original main term provides the necessary code. (Evidence: pg no: 11-12, L60-L64)",
