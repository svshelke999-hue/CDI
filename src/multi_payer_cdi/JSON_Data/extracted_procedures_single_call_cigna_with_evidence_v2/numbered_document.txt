L8| The
L9| following coverage policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna. Coverage policies are
L10| intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard Cigna benefit plans and are used by medical
L11| directors and other health care professionals in making medical necessity and other coverage determinations.  Please note the terms of a customer’s particular benefit plan document may differ
L12| significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these coverage policies are based. For example,
L13| a customer’s benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a
L14| coverage policy.
L15| In t
L16| he event of a conflict, a customer’s benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the
L17| coverage policy. In the absence of federal or state coverage mandates, benefits are ultimately determined
L18| by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of:
L19| 1. The
L20| terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service
L21| 2. Any applicable laws and regulations
L22| 3. Any relevant collateral source materials including coverage poli cies
L23| 4. The specific facts of the particular situation
L24| Cov
L25| erage policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage policies are not
L26| recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines.
L27| Th

L60| Shoulder Surgery -Arthroscopic and Open Procedures  Definitions
L61|  Acromioplasty:  the rem oval of bone from th e acromion and p artial resection of the
L62| coracoacrom ial ligamen t.
L63|  Adhesi ve Capsulitis/A rthrofibrosis:  a condi tion of the shoulder characterized by
L64| stiffness, loss of motion  (cont racture), and pa in due to scarring in and/or around the
L65| shoulder joint.  Condi tions that have been sugges ted to predispose an individual  to
L66| adhesiv e capsul itis include tr auma, surgery to the shou lder, inflammatory  diseases,
L67| diabetes, hyperthyroid ism, dyslipi demia. Often called frozen sh oulder, adhesive
L68| capsulitis is clinically divided into classes:
L69|  Primary adhesive c apsulitis is characterized by a signif icant limitation o f both
L70| active and passi ve m otions on the shoulder; individual s are ty pically unable to
L71| recall a possi ble cause of the con dition (idiop athic adhesi ve capsulitis).
L72|  Secondary a dhesi ve capsulitis is c harac terized by a trauma or a po ssible
L73| cause pri or to the o nset of the sym ptoms, such as fracture of the hum erus,
L74| rotator cuff repair, sh oulder girdle injury/sur gery, or prolonge d immobilization.
L75|  Distal Clavicle Excision: the re moval of the end of the clavicle at the
L76| acromioclavicular (AC) joint. T he su perio r AC ligament remains intact so that t he joint
L77| remains stab le.
L78|  Impingem ent Syndrome comm only results from friction, abrasio n, and inflammation
L79| of the rotator cuff and t he long head of the biceps t endon with the subacromial arch
L80| (anterior lip of the acrom ion, coracoacromial li gament, and acromioclavicular joint)
L81| from acute t raum a, repetitive use or degene rative chan ges.
L82|  Labral Tears r esult when t he glenoid labrum becom es injur ed or torn. Tears are
L83| typically classified by th e posit ion of the tear in relation to the glenoid.
L84|  Bankart Tear: a tear in the labrum located in t he front, low er (anterior, inferior)
L85| part of the glenoid. This ty pe of  tear occurs m ost comm only during a shoulder
L86| dislocation a nd makes t he shoulder more pron e to recurrent di slocations.
L87|  SLAP T ear (Superior Labr al, Anterior, and P osterior Tear): a tear in the
L88| labrum that cov ers the top pa rt of the glenoid from th e front to back. A S LAP tear
L89| occurs at the poi nt where th e long head of the biceps te ndon attaches. This ty pe
L90| of tear oc curs most comm only during fal ls on an outstretched arm.
L91|  Non-Surgic al Management  (with re gard to t he treatment of shoulder pain) : any
L92| provider -directed non-surg ical treatment that has be en demonstrated in t he scienti fic
L93| literature to be eff icacious and/ or is consid ered reasonable care in the treatment of
L94| shoulder pain. The types of treatment in volved can includ e, but are not lim ited to:
L95| relative res t/acti vity modific ation, supervised physiotherapy  modalities and
L96| supervised th erapeut ic exercises, prescription and non- prescription medications,
L97| assistive devices (e.g., sling, splint, brace), and/ or injections (i.e., steroid).
L98|  Rotator Cuff Tears: a disruption of the tendon(s) of the rotator cuff muscles which
L99| attach the humerus to the scapula and are important in shoulder movements and
L100| maintaining glenohumeral joint stability. The supraspinatus tendon is most
L101| commonly involved, but the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis tendons
L102| can also be torn.

L108| Shoulder Surgery -Arthroscopic and Open Procedures   Defining whether a rotator cuff tear is acute has relevance to treatment.  In
L109| evaluating patients, the surgeon should attempt to properly identify patients with acute tears as opposed to patients with pre- existing chronic tears that become
L110| symptomatic after an injury event. A discrete traumatic event is more suggestive of acute tear. Physical examination findings including supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle atrophy, as well as internal and external rotation lag signs, may be indicative of larger and more chronic rotator cuff tears.
L111|  Evaluation of rotator cuff muscle quality with CT or MRI is an important consideration. Chronic and larger tears are associated with muscle atrophy and fatty replacement, both of which correlate with inferior functional outcome after rotator cuff repair. It is thought that early repair of acute rotator cuff tears might mitigate the development of chronic tendon and muscle pathology and improve functional outcomes.
L112|  Classification of rotator cuff tears (based upon surgical findings):
L113|  Partial- thickness tears, also called incomplete tears (Ellman):
L114|  Grade 1: < 3 mm deep (< 25% thickness)
L115|  Grade 2: 3 –6 mm in depth but not exceeding 50% of the tendon thickness
L116|  Grade 3: > 6 mm deep (> 50% thickness)
L117|  Full-thickness tears, also called complete tears (Cofield):
L118|  Small: < 1 cm
L119|  Medium : 1-3 cm
L120|  Large: 3- 5 cm
L121|  Massive: > 5 cm
L122|  Shoulder Dislocation: the complete loss of the humeral articulation with the g lenoid
L123| fossa, u sually as a r esult of acut e traum a.
L124|  Shoulder Instability and/or Laxity: a par tial loss of the glenohum eral ar ticulation of
L125| which there are t wo categ ories:
L126|  Post-traumatic shou lder instability inclu des an individual  with a p revious injury
L127| that has stretched or torn the ligamen ts of the shoulder.
L128|  Atraumatic inst ability and/or laxity  includes an individual  with ge neralized
L129| looseness of the jo ints “double-jointed” or “multi-directional instability ” usually
L130| representing a ty pe of congenital ligament ous laxity.
L131|  Shoulder S
L132| ubluxation: a par tial loss of humeral articulation with the gl enoid fos sa
L133| (incomplete or partial di slocation) usually as a result of repeti tive traum a to th e
L134| degree t hat symptoms are prod uced.
L135|  Subac romial D ecom pressi on: the removal of bone or other abnormality to enlarge
L136| the s pace between the rotator cuff musculature a nd th e acromion.
