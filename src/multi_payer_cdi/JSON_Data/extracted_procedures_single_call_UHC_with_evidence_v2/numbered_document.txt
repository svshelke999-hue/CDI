L88| Clinical Evidence
L89| Subacromial Balloon Spacers  (SABS)
L90| The InSpace™ Subacromial Tissue Spacer System (Stryker)  is a new,  minimally invasive, biodegradable balloon spacer
L91| for treating massive, inoperable rotator cuff tears (MIRCTs). According to the manufacturer, it preserves musculoskeletal
L92| and bone tissues , does not require the use of an anchor, and does not require a permanent implant. It is used as a spacer
L93| to eliminate friction between the acromion and the humeral head or rotator cuff to restore shoulder function and reduce
L94| pain. It is designed to biodegrade over the course of twelve months. The current  published literature is at high- risk of bias
L95| due to the small sample size, single -center focus, retrospective design, and lack of randomization, blinding, and control.
L96| There are device- related complications , and long- term studies are necessary as short -term results appear to degrade
L97| over time. Furthermore, studies include individuals with varying rotator cuff tear sizes.

L100| Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.
L101| Sandler and associates (2024) conducted a dual -armed systematic review and meta- analysis of over 1000 individuals to
L102| compare the outcomes after SAB spacer placement versus arthroscopic debridement for MIRCTs. For the SAB arm, 14 of
L103| 449 studies were considered eligible for inclusion, while 14 of 272 were considered eligible for inclusion in the
L104| debridement arm. Uncovered by the investigation were 528 individuals eligible for inclusion in the SAB arm, 479 in the
L105| debridement arm, and 69.9% of those individuals undergoing SAB placement also underwent concomitant debridement.
L106| The results of the exploration found were decreases in the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score and increases in the Constant score were discovered to be significantly more following debridement ( –0.7 points [ p < .001] and ±5.5 points [ p <
L107| .001], respectively), although the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS)  for the VAS was not attained after either
L108| procedure. Both SAB placement and debridement significantly improved the range of motion (ROM) in forward
L109| flexion/forward elevation, internal and external rotation, and abduction ( p < .001). Rates of general complication were
L110| greater following debridement versus SAB placement (5.2% ±5.6% vs. 3.5% ±6.3%, respectively; p < .001); however,
L111| there were no significant variances among SAB placement and debridement in rates of persistent symptoms necessitating
L112| a reintervention (3.3% ±6.2% vs 3.8% ±7.3%, respectively; p = .252) or reoperation rates (5.1% ±7.6% vs 4.8% ±8.4%,
L113| respectively; p = .552). The mean time to conversion to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty was 11.0 versus 25.4 months,
L114| respectively, for the SAB versus debridement arm. The limitations of the analysis consist of inconsistencies between follow -up times, with the follow -up time associated with debridement being nearly twice as long as the follow -up time
L115| related to SAB placement, are likely attributable to the recentness of SAB use globally, which may confuse evaluations
L116| with older debridement literature given the evolution in arthroscopic surgery over time. The time to reverse total shoulder
L117| arthroplasty ( RTSA)  was not uniformly reported between studies and was decided based on either individual patient data
L118| or weighted means. Also, there were alterations in using and reporting rotator cuff tears  size and type, further obscuring
L119| direct comparisons. The authors concluded that while SAB placement was associated with adequate postoperative
L120| outcomes for treating MIRCTs, there was no clear advantage over debridement only. Shorter operative times combined
L121| with better postoperative results and prolonged times to conversion to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty gave debridement a more desirable choice. While there may be a role for SAB placement in poor surgical candidates, there is
L122| promising evidence to support debridement alone with no SAB placement for treating MIRCTs. (level IV evidence).
L123| In a 2024 systematic review and meta -analysis, Sirignano et al. sought to decide the efficacy of the subacromial balloon
L124| spacer implantation (SBSI) from both surgical and rehabilitative perspectives to improve outcomes for individuals with
L125| massive rotator cuff tear. To effectively evaluate the results of the literature, the authors assessed pre‐ surgery (baseline),
L126| 12‐month (12 ‐m), and 24‐ month (24‐ m) post ‐SBSI mean changes and compared them using one‐ way analysis of variance
L127| (ANOVA ) and Scheffe post hoc tests and comparative study effect sizes were calculated (p ≤ 0.05). The review consisted
L128| of 27 studies with 894 individuals (67.8 ±5 years of age) and 29.4 ±17‐month follow ‐up. Modified Coleman Methodology
L129| Scores (MCMS) revealed fair overall quality (mean = 61.4 ± 11). Constant –Murley scores improved from 34.8 ±6
L130| (baseline) to 64.2 ±9 (12‐ m) and 67.9 ±8 (24‐ m) (12 ‐m, 24 ‐m > baseline, p < 0.001). ASES scores improved from 35.1
L131| ±14 (baseline) to 83.3 ±7 (12‐ m) and 81.8 ±5 (24‐ m) (12 ‐m, 24 ‐m > baseline, p < 0.001). VAS pain scores improved from
L132| 6.6 ±1 (baseline) to 2.6 ±1 (12‐ m) and 2.0 ±1 (24‐ m) (12 ‐m, 24 ‐m < baseline, p < 0.001). Flexion increased from 108.5
L133| ±25° (baseline) to 128.5 ±30° (12‐ m) and 151.2 ±14° (24‐ m) (24 ‐m > 12 ‐m, baseline, p = 0.01). Abduction increased from
L134| 97.7 ±24° (baseline) to 116.3 ±23° (12‐ m) and 142.3 ±15° (24‐ m) (24 ‐m > 12 ‐m, baseline, p = 0.02). External rotation (ER)
L135| in adduction changed from 33.1 ±7° (baseline) to 32.5 ±4° (12‐ m) and 53.9 ±9° (24‐ m) (24 ‐m > 12 ‐m, baseline, p = 0.01).
L136| ER at 90° abduction increased from 56.3 ±3° (baseline) to 83.5 ±5° (12 ‐m) and 77.1 ±4° (24‐ m) (24 ‐m, 12 ‐m > baseline, p
L137| = 0.01). Comparison studies, however, showed insignificant conclusions with small effect sizes. There are many
L138| limitations to this systematic review and meta- analysis. Most of the reviewed studies had relatively small sample sizes; all
L139| subjects included were middle- aged or elderly who, without effective surgical intervention, were destined for attempted
L140| partial rotator cuff repair with or without SBSI, attempted rotator cuff repair with scaffold supplementation, superior
L141| capsular reconstruction, tendon transfer or RTSA. Although the cohort studies were promising, they were less so when
L142| they included a control or comparison group of individuals who underwent attempted rotator cuff repair or debridement
L143| alone. Lastly, the perceptions of the surgeon and physical therapist may differ on the MCMS details needed to guide the
L144| clinical care provided by each healthcare professional. The authors concluded that although overall fair MCMS scores at
L145| 24-m post -SBSI, shoulder function increased, and pain decreased. Comparative studies that were more rigorous showed
L146| insignificant findings. Those with the potential for reestablishing the essential glenohumeral joint force couple that
L147| depresses the humeral head on the glenoid fossa and who follow physical therapy may be more prone to active success
L148| following SBSI. Outcomes may improve through improved preoperative healthcare team conversations, more comprehensive scoring options for the MCMS postoperative rehabilitation description questions, and a high agreement
L149| level among surgical and rehabilitation teams for surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation description scores.
L150| The 2023 systematic review and meta -analysis conducted by Berk et al. sought to review and synthesize the literature
L151| reporting on the trial outcomes following the implantation of a SABS for treating individuals with irreparable rotator cuff
L152| tears. Amongst included studies, a total of 894 shoulders (886 people), with an average follow -up of 30.4 (range, 12- 56)
L153| months, were included. The results showed that all postoperative reported outcomes improved significantly from baseline,
L154| including the constant score (mean difference, 33.53;  p < 0.001), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score
L155| Surgery of the Shoulder  Page 4 of 6
L156| UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 05/01/2025
L157| Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.
L158| (mean difference, 40.38;  p < 0.001), Oxford Shoulder Score (mean difference, 12.05;  p = 0.004), and VAS for
L159| pain/Numeric Pain Rating Scale values (mean difference, -3.79;  p < 0.001). Forward elevation (mean difference, 24.44;  p
L160| < 0.001), abduction (mean difference, 52.30;  p = 0.02), and ER (mean difference, 15.22;  p < 0.001) improved. Device -
L161| related complications occurred at a rate of 3.6%, the most common of which were balloon migration (1.0%) and synovitis
L162| (0.6%). In the end, 5% of participants needed salvage reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The authors concluded that the
L163| short -term outcomes for SABS could be a safe and effective treatment and appears to be associated with early
L164| improvements in postoperative pain and function. Limitations to conclusively interpret the available evidence include
L165| clinical heterogeneity, use of concomitant procedures, and variations in patient selection. The therapeutic value of SABS
L166| is still unknown compared to other currently accepted treatment strategies. Additionally,  the long- term implications of
L167| SABS use on the outcomes of further salvage procedures and how long symptomatic improvement can be expected are
L168| unknown.
L169| In 2023, Kunze and associates performed a systematic literature review to understand the propensity for clinically
L170| meaningful improvement after individuals received SBSI  for massive rotator cuff repairs. Clinical outcomes were
L171| measured through the Freeman -Tukey double arcsine transformation to quantify the pooled rate of clinically meaningful
L172| improvements in outcomes as assessed using the minimal clinically important difference (MCID),  PASS, and substantial
L173| clinical benefit (SCB). When data were irregularly presented to prevent misleading reporting, qualitative analysis was
L174| performed. The results showed an overall pooled rate of MCID achievement for the Constant -Murley score of 83% (95%
L175| CI, 71% -93%; range, 40% -98%), with 6 of 8 studies reporting rates equivalent to or more than 85%. One study registered
L176| a 98% rate of PASS achievement for the Constant -Murley score at a 3- year follow -up. The rate of MCID achievement for
L177| the ASES score varies between 83% and 87.5%. The rate of PASS achievement for the ASES score was 56% at a 2- year
L178| follow -up, while the rate of SCB achievement for the ASES score was 83% and 82% at a 1-  and 2- year follow -up,
L179| correspondingly. At 1- year follow -up, 74% and 78% of participants reached the MCID for the Numeric Rating Scale and
L180| Oxford Shoulder Score, correspondingly. At three years, 69% of participants achieved the MCID for the Numeric Rating
L181| Scale, and 87% achieved it for the Oxford Shoulder Score. The authors concluded that those who underwent isolated
L182| SBSI  for massive irreparable rotator cuff (MRCTs) showed a high rate of clinically significant improvement in results at
L183| short to mid -term follow -up. More studies are necessary to appropriately define and evaluate the rates of achieving the
L184| PASS and SCB after the implantation (included in the 2023 Hayes updated review).
L185| Verma et al. (2022 ) conducted a multicenter, single- blinded,  randomized controlled trial  (RCT) comparing the I nSpace
L186| subacromial balloon spacer  implant to partial repair of full -thickness massive rotator cuff tears. One hundred eighty -four
L187| individuals met the inclusion criteria: ≥ age 40, magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) imaging showing a full -thickness
L188| massive rotator cuff tear measuring ≥ 5cm and involving ≥  2 tendons within nine months of study enrollment, functional
L189| deltoid muscle and preserved passive ROM  on physical examination, VAS score greater than 30mm and who underwent
L190| failed conservative therapy for at least four months. Participants randomized to receive partial repair underwent suture
L191| anchor repair of the posterosuperior  rotator cuff, and concomitant procedures were done on both groups. Follow -up was
L192| completed on days ten, week s 6 and 3,6,12,  and 24 months, and included examination, review of complications,
L193| reoperations, medications,  and patient -reported outcomes. Post -operative rehabilitation was standardized for both groups.
L194| The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to month 24 for the American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) score, and secondary outcomes included the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) score, Constant -Murley
L195| shoulder score, VAS score, EuroQol -5 Dimensions -5 Level (EQ -5D-5L) quality -of-life (QOL) score, and active ROM . The
L196| results showed that the InSpace demonstrated functional  and patient -reported outcomes comparable to partial repair at
L197| month 12, maintained to month 24 (2-year follow -up is well beyond the anticipated degradation timeframe, indicating
L198| clinical improvement is sustained even after the implant has biodegraded). The I nSpace group showed earlier recovery at
L199| week six, as shown by ASES, WORC, Constant -Murley scores , and ROM  improvements . These results are limited by a
L200| lack of standardized concomitant procedures performed in both groups , which may have affected the results.
L201| Furthermore, the repair techniques and the non-blinding of the examiners are a potential source of bias. Further studies
L202| addressing these limitations and longer -term follow -up are warranted (included in  the 2022 ECRI report , Kunze et al.
L203| 2023, Sandler et al. 2024, and Sirignano et al. 2024) .
L204| In a 2022 Hayes Evolving Evidence Review, it was concluded that there are minimal levels of support for using the
L205| InSpace Biodegradable Subacromial  Spacer for treating irreparable rotator  cuff tears. In 2023, Hayes updated the
L206| evolving evidence review to include four newly published clinical studies, two newly published systematic reviews, and
L207| one newly published guideline. The 2023 annual  updated review of the evidence indicates  an unlikely or no change in the
L208| current level of support. While a small evidence base is associated with improved patient -centered outcomes, the very
L209| poor quality of available studies  suggest s that the potential clinical benefit should be considered cautiously .
L210| A 2021 ECRI clinical evidence assessment, updated in 2022,  entitled InSpace Subacromial Tissue Spacer System
L211| (Stryker Corp.) for Treating Massive Rotator Cuff Tears concluded that based on the results of one systematic review, two
L212| RCTs , and four nonrandomized comparison studies, the InSpace is safe and improves function and QOL for individuals
L213| Surgery of the Shoulder  Page 5 of 6
L214| UnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 05/01/2025
L215| Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.
L216| with large to massive, MRCT. However, rotator cuff tear s included too few participants to form conclusions about its
L217| comparative effectiveness to arthroscopic repair or debridement , and none of the studies reported outcomes longer than
L218| two years. The 2024 update on InSpace’s safety and efficacy  shows that comparative evidence is  inconclusive . Outcomes
L219| show improved pain;  however , the evidence is low for clinically meaningful improvement from baseline, significant
L220| improvement compared to debridement alone or with partial repair.  Larger RCTs comparing InSpace as a standalone
L221| treatment and as  an adjunct treatment with other MRCT treatments and reporting on long -term patient -oriented outcomes
L222| are needed to confirm  findings and address evidence gaps , which may be partially addressed in ongoing clinical  trials .
L223| Clinical Practice Guidelines
L224| National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
L225| The Interventional procedures guidance published by NICE in 2023 offers the following guidance for biodegradable
L226| subacromial spacer insertion for rotator cuff tears:
L227| • When debridement is a suitable option, biodegradable subacromial spacer insertion for rotator cuff tears should not be
L228| used. Find out why NICE recommends not to use some procedures on the NICE interventional procedures guidance
L229| page.
L230| • When debridement is not a suitable option, biodegradable subacromial spacer insertion for rotator cuff tears should be
L231| used only in research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page.
L232| • Further research should ideally be randomized  controlled trials. It should report details of patient selection (including
L233| demographics and the tear size), measures of shoulder function, pain relief and QOL. Follow up should ideally be for
L234| at least 2 years.
L235| • Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary team experienced in managing the condition, including
L236| clinicians with specific training in the procedure.
L237| • The procedure should only be done by surgeons with specific training in inserting the device.
