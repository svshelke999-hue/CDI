L73| © 2023 Carelon Medical Benefits Management. All rights reserved .  34 Knee Arthroplasty (Total/Partial/Revision Knee
L74| Replacement)
L75| Description and Scope
L76| Knee arthroplasty involves removal of some or all of the diseased articular surfaces of the knee, followed by
L77| resurfacing with metal and polyethylene prosthetic components. Numerous implants composed of various
L78| biomaterials have been approved by the  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in knee arthroplasty
L79| procedures. The goal of the procedure is long -term pain relief and restoration of function.
L80| This guideline addresses total knee arthroplasty  (TKA), revision TKA, patellar and patella fe moral arthroplasty,
L81| and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) performed as elective, non -emergent  procedures and not as
L82| part of the care of a congenital condition, acute or traumatic event such as fracture (excluding periprosthetic
L83| fracture).
L84| All knee arthroplasties are inclusive of the reattachment of any muscles divided for access to the knee,
L85| accompanying excision of osteophytes, synovectomy and knee arthrotomy with associated removal of debris.
L86| Revision knee arthroplasty is inclusive of the exchang e of some or all of the components of a prior knee
L87| replacement with permanent replacements. It is not inclusive of exchange of components for visualization or joint
L88| access alone.
L89| Clinical Indications
L90| The following general requirements apply to all indicat ions except where they differ from the specific
L91| requirements. The specific requirements take precedence over any stated general requirement.
L92| General Information
L93| The terms in the section provide operational definitions when they are referenced as requiremen ts in the
L94| guideline.
L95| Documentation supporting medical necessity and a clearly stated plan of care should be submitted at the time of
L96| the request and must include the following components:
L97| Clinical notes  describing symptom duration and severity, specific functional limitations related to symptoms, and
L98| type and duration of all therapeutic measures provided. If conservative management is not appropriate, the
L99| reason must be clearly documented.
L100| Conservative management1 must include a combination of strategies to reduce inflammation, alleviate pain, and
L101| correct underlying dysfunction, including physical therapy AND  at least ONE  complementary conservative
L102| treatment strategy.
L103| • Physical therapy requirement  includes ANY  of the following:
L104| o Physical therapy rendered by  a qualified provider of physical therapy services
L105| o Supervised home treatment program that includes ALL of the following:

L118| o Alternative therapies such as activity modification, and/or a trial period of rest (e.g., from the
L119| aggravating/contributing factors) , where applicable
L120| 1 Additional condition or procedure -specific requirements may apply and can be found in the respective sections
L121| of the guideline.
L122| 2 In the absence of contraindications
L123| Clinical reevaluation . In most cases, reevaluation should include a physical examination. Direct contact by other
L124| methods, such as telephone communication or electronic messaging, may substitute for in -person evaluation
L125| when circumstances preclude an office visit. Clinical reevaluation must be done in reasonable proximity to the
L126| anticipated date of service such that the patient’s condition would be unlikely to change by the date of service.
L127| Failure of conservative management  requires ALL of the following:
L128| • Patient has completed a full course of conservative management (as de fined above) for the current
L129| episode of care
L130| • Worsening of or no significant improvement in signs and/or symptoms upon clinical reevaluation
L131| • More invasive forms of therapy are being considered
L132| Documentation of compliance with a plan of therapy that include s elements from these areas is required where
L133| conservative management is appropriate.
L134| Reporting symptom severity . Severity of pain and its associated impact on activities of daily living (ADLs) and
L135| instrumental ADLs (IADLs) are key factors in determining t he need for intervention. For purposes of this guideline,
L136| significant pain and functional impairment refer to pain rated at least 3 out of 10 in intensity and associated with
L137| inability to perform at least two (2) ADLs and/or IADLs.

L139| either or both of the following methods:
L140| • X-ray report or provider interpretation of x -rays that utilizes or can be correlated with the Kellgren -
L141| Lawrence grading system o f osteoarthritis
L142| • MRI report from a radiologist that utilizes or can be correlated with the modified Outerbridge or similar
L143| classification system related to articular cartilage injury and osteoarthritis
L144| See Appendix  for a description of these grading systems.
L145| For x -ray interpretation, the provider shall submit a detailed imaging description that correlates with clinical
L146| findings of the requested procedure. In the absence of a detailed description , the provider may submit a report
L147| from an independent radiologist. The results of all imaging studies should correlate with the clinical findings in
L148| support of the requested procedure.
L149| For advanced imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound, bone scan), there must be a report from a radiologist that correlates
L150| with clinical findings. In the absence of such a report, the summary findings from the radiology report should be
L151| included in the clinical records .
L152| Imaging reports should be thorough and describe the presence or absence of subchondral cysts, subchondral
L153| sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, avascular necrosis , or bone on bone articulations. The
L154| degree of joint space narrowing should also be noted.

L310| Description and Scope
L311| Knee arthroscopy is a surgical procedure in which a fiberoptic camera is inserted into the knee joint through a
L312| small incision. In addition to allowing the surgeon to visualize the joint, arthroscopy may also be utilized for
L313| treatment of a variety of condi tions involving the joint structures.
L314| This guideline addresses knee arthroscopy when performed as an elective, non -emergent  procedure and not as
L315| part of the care of an acute fracture.
L316| Articular cartilage lesions in weight -bearing joints often fail to heal  spontaneously and may be associated with
L317| pain, loss of function, and long -term complications such as osteoarthritis. A number of surgical techniques have
L318| been developed to treat these lesions.
L319| Procedures to treat focal articular cartilage defects can be c lassified as:
L320| 1. Palliative (lavage, chondroplasty)
L321| 2. Reparative (microfracture, abrasion arthroplasty)
L322| 3. Restorative (autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral allograft, or osteochondral autograft)*.
L323| *See Treatment of Osteochondral Defects
L324| Chondroplast y or debridement is a smoothing or shaving of symptomatic partial -thickness cartilage lesions or
L325| chondral flaps (unstable mechanical source of pain).
L326| Microfracture involves drilling multiple holes through the subchondral bone to promote bleeding and fibroc artilage
L327| growth.
L328| Abrasion arthroplasty involves abrading the subchondral bone to the depth necessary to promote bleeding and
L329| fibrocartilage growth.
L330| Both microfracture and abrasion arthroplasty are typically performed on lesions less than 4 cm2.
L331| All arthros copic and open knee procedure codes are inclusive of diagnostic arthroscopy and manipulation under
L332| anesthesia.
L333| Clinical Indications
L334| The following general requirements apply to all indications except where they differ from the specific
L335| requirements. The spe cific requirements take precedence over any stated general requirement.
L336| General Information
L337| The terms in the section provide operational definitions when they are referenced as requirements in the

L727| Description
L728| Meniscal allograft transplantation of the knee is a surgical procedure used to restore normal meniscal function by
L729| replacing a damaged or absent meniscus with donor cadaver allograft cartilage. The procedure is an option for a
L730| subset of patients who have p ain or disability attributed to insufficient cushioning and lubrication of the joint.
L731| A significant subset of these patients have undergone one or more procedures to remove portions of the
L732| meniscus due to tears or other injury. The goal of the procedure i s reduction in pain, prevention of degenerative
L733| changes to the cartilage and subchondral bone, and restoration of the mechanical properties of the knee joint.
L734| Clinical Indications
L735| The following general requirements apply to all indications except where th ey differ from the specific
L736| requirements. The specific requirements take precedence over any stated general requirement.
L737| General Information
L738| The terms in the section provide operational definitions when they are referenced as requirements in the
L739| guideline.
L740| Documentation supporting medical necessity and a clearly stated plan of care should be submitted at the time of
L741| the request and must include the following components:
L742| Operative report of a prior arthroscopic procedure and/or MRI of the knee performed wit hin the past 12
L743| months . The provider shall submit a detailed imaging report that correlates with clinical findings of the requested
L744| procedure. In the absence of a detailed report, the provider will be required to submit a report from an
L745| independent radiolo gist. The results of all imaging studies should correlate with the clinical findings in support of
L746| the requested procedure.
L747| Conservative management1 must include a combination of strategies to reduce inflammation, alleviate pain, and
L748| correct underlying dys function, including physical therapy AND  at least ONE  complementary conservative
L749| treatment strategy.
L750| • Physical therapy requirement  includes ANY  of the following:
L751| o Physical therapy rendered by a qualified provider of physical therapy services
L752| o Supervised home treatment program which includes flexibility and muscle strengthening
L753| exercises that includes ALL of the following:
L754| ▪ Participation in a patient -specific or tailored program
L755| ▪ Initial active instruction by MD/DO/PT with redemonstration of patie nt ability to perform
L756| exercises
L757| ▪ Compliance (documented or by clinician attestation on follow -up evaluation)
L758| o Exception to the physical therapy requirement in unusual circumstances (for instance
L759| intractable pain so severe that physical therapy is not possibl e) when clearly documented in the
L760| medical record
L761| • Complementary conservative treatment requirement  includes ANY  of the following:
L762| o Anti-inflammatory medications and analgesics2
L763| o Adjunctive medications such as nerve membrane stabilizers or muscle relaxants2

L767| aggravating/contributing factors), where applicable
L768| 1 Additional condition or procedure -specific requirements may  apply and can be found in the respective sections
L769| of the guideline.
L770| 2 In the absence of contraindications
L771| Clinical reevaluation . In most cases, reevaluation should include a physical examination. Direct contact by other
L772| methods, such as telephone communic ation or electronic messaging, may substitute for in -person evaluation
L773| when circumstances preclude an office visit. Clinical reevaluation must be done in reasonable proximity to the
L774| anticipated date of service such that the patient’s condition would be unl ikely to change by the date of service.
L775| Failure of conservative management  requires ALL of the following:
L776| • Patient has completed a full course of conservative management (as defined above) for the current
L777| episode of care
L778| • Worsening of or no significant improvement in signs and/or symptoms upon clinical reevaluation
L779| • More invasive forms of therapy are being considered
L780| Documentation of compliance with a plan of therapy that includes elements from these areas is required where
L781| conservative management is appropriate.
L782| Reporting symptom severity . Severity of pain and its associated impact on activities of daily living (ADLs) and
L783| instrumental ADLs (IADLs) are key factors in determining the need for intervention. For purposes of th is guideline,
L784| significant pain and functional impairment refer to pain rated at least 3 out of 10 in intensity and associated with
L785| inability to perform at least two (2) ADLs and/or IADLs.
L786| Meniscal Allograft Transplantation of the Knee
L787| Meniscal allograft t ransplantation of the knee is considered medically necessary as a treatment for individuals
L788| with significant partial (more than 50%) or complete loss of the meniscus, as documented by previous operative
L789| reports, MRI, or diagnostic arthroscopy, when ALL of the following criteria are met:
L790| • Age 55 or younger and skeletally mature
L791| • Knee pain refractory to conservative treatment
L792| • Ligamentous stability either prior to surgery or achieved concurrently with meniscal transplantation
L793| • Normal alignment without varus or va lgus deformities
L794| • Mild to moderate articular damage (Outerbridge grade II or less)
L795| Exclusions

L827| Description and Scope
L828| Articular cartilage lesions in weight -bearing joints often fail to heal spontaneously and may be associated with
L829| pain, loss of function, and long -term complications such as osteoarthritis. A number of surgical te chniques have
L830| been developed to treat these lesions, but an established therapy with long -term efficacy remains elusive.
L831| Procedures to treat focal articular cartilage defects can be classified as:
L832| 1. Palliative (lavage, chondroplasty)
L833| 2. Reparative (microfractur e, abrasion arthroplasty)
L834| 3. Restorative (autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral allograft, or osteochondral autograft)*
L835| The most widely used are bone marrow stimulation techniques to induce an influx of mesenchymal stem cells into
L836| the defect.
L837| Chondroplasty or debridement is a smoothing or shaving of symptomatic partial -thickness cartilage lesions or
L838| chondral flaps (unstable mechanical source of pain). See knee arthroscopy section.
L839| Microfracture involves drilling multiple holes through the subc hondral bone to promote bleeding and fibrocartilage
L840| growth. See knee arthroscopy section.
L841| Abrasion arthroplasty involves abrading the subchondral bone to the depth necessary to promote bleeding and
L842| fibrocartilage growth. See Knee Arthroscopy  section.
L843| Both microfracture and abrasion arthroplasty are typically performed on lesions less than 4 cm2.
L844| Other techniques involve transplantation of osteochondral tissue from non -weight bearin g sites, autologous
L845| chrondrocyte transplant, and use of synthetic bone filler material or scaffolds.
L846| This guideline addresses treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee, ankle, and other joints using the
L847| following procedures or devices:
L848| • Autologous cho ndrocyte transplant (ACT)
L849| • Minced cartilage repair
L850| • Osteochondral allograft
L851| • Osteochondral autograft (OATS/mosaicplasty)
L852| • Resorbable synthetic bone filler materials
L853| • Microfracture

L921| Osteochondritis Dissecans (Juv enile and Adult)
L922| Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a distinct condition that develops primarily in children and adolescents. A
L923| focal area of ischemia in the bone results in a progressive separation of a small segment of bone and overlying
L924| cartilage. OCD a ffects the medial or lateral femoral condyles (not the patella, femoral trochlea, or tibial plateau)
L925| (AAOS AUC). OCD is usually regarded as either juvenile OCD (JOCD) (occurring with an open epiphyseal plate)
L926| or adult OCD (AOCD) (after the physis has close d). The etiology of OCD lesions remains unclear and is
L927| characterized by an aseptic necrosis in the subchondral bone area. OCD is not associated with acute trauma.
L928| Juvenile OCD
L929| Surgical treatment (e.g., microfracture, pin fixation) is considered medically n ecessary when BOTH  of the
L930| following criteria are met :
L931| • Failure of 3 months of conservative management (e.g., immobilization, restricted weight -bearing,
L932| avoidance of sports activities)
L933| • Presence of an unstable lesion (based on advanced imaging or arthroscopic  evaluation)
L934| Adult OCD
L935| Surgical treatment (e.g., microfracture, pin fixation, osteochondral graft) is considered medically necessary when
L936| BOTH  of the following criteria are met :

L949| Cartilaginous defects of the talus
L950| Osteochondral allograft transplantation t o treat cartilaginous defects of the talus is considered medically
L951| necessary when EITHER  of the following criteria are met:

L953| would be inadequate due to lesion size, depth, or location
L954| • Revision surgery after failed prior marrow stimulation for large (area > 1. 0 cm2) or cystic (volume > 3.0
L955| cm3) osteochondral lesions of the talus when autografting would be inadequate due to lesion size, depth,
L956| or location
L957| Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation
L958| Cartilaginous defects of the knee
L959| Osteochondral autograft transplantation, either osteochondral autograft transplant (OAT) or autologous
L960| mosaicplasty, is considered medically necessary to tr eat cartilaginous defects of the knee when ALL of the
L961| following criteria are met:
L962| • Size of the cartilage defect is between 1.0 cm and 2.5 cm2 in total area, as documented by MRI or
L963| arthroscopy
L964| • Condition involves a focal, full thickness, (grade III or IV) is olated defect of the knee involving the weight
L965| bearing surface of the medial or lateral femoral condyles or trochlear region (trochlear groove of the
