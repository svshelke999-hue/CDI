PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Full-thickness rotator cuff tear, right shoulder
2. Subacromial impingement syndrome, right shoulder

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Full-thickness rotator cuff tear, right shoulder
2. Subacromial impingement syndrome, right shoulder

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, right shoulder
2. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression, right shoulder

ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal anesthesia

INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with right shoulder pain and limited range of motion. 
MRI demonstrated a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Patient failed conservative management 
including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections.

OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
The patient was placed in the beach chair position. General anesthesia was induced. 
The right shoulder was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.

Arthroscopic portals were established. Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a full-thickness 
tear of the supraspinatus tendon measuring approximately 2.5 cm. The subacromial space 
was entered and significant subacromial spurring was identified.

The rotator cuff tear was debrided and prepared. A double-row repair was performed using 
suture anchors. The subacromial decompression was completed with removal of the acromial spur.

All instruments were removed. Portals were closed with simple interrupted sutures. 
A sterile dressing was applied.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal

COMPLICATIONS:
None
