OPERATIVE REPORT

Patient Name: Sarah Johnson
MRN: 987654321
Date of Service: October 16, 2025
Surgeon: Dr. Michael Brown, MD

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, right shoulder
2. Arthroscopic labral repair, right shoulder

INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear and 
labral pathology of the right shoulder. She has failed extensive conservative 
management including physical therapy for 6 months and multiple corticosteroid 
injections.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Full-thickness rotator cuff tear, right shoulder, supraspinatus tendon
2. Superior labral tear (SLAP lesion), right shoulder
3. Chronic shoulder pain with functional limitations

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as above

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:

The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in beach chair position. 
General anesthesia with interscalene block was administered. The right upper 
extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.

DIAGNOSTIC ARTHROSCOPY:
Standard posterior portal was established. Glenohumeral joint was inspected 
revealing a superior labral tear extending from 10 o'clock to 2 o'clock position. 
The biceps anchor was intact.

LABRAL REPAIR:
The labral tear was debrided back to stable tissue. Two knotless suture anchors 
were placed at the superior glenoid to repair the SLAP lesion. The labrum was 
securely reattached with good tissue quality.

ROTATOR CUFF REPAIR:
The arthroscope was moved to the subacromial space. A full-thickness tear of the 
supraspinatus tendon measuring 2 cm x 1.5 cm was identified. The tear edges were 
freshened and mobilized.

The footprint on the greater tuberosity was prepared with removal of soft tissue 
and light decortication. Two medial row anchors were placed followed by two 
lateral row knotless anchors in a double-row configuration. The repair showed 
excellent tissue quality and coverage of the footprint.

CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT HISTORY:
- Physical therapy: 24 weeks of dedicated rotator cuff rehabilitation
  (documented sessions from 4/1/2025 to 9/30/2025)
- Medications: NSAIDs (naproxen 500mg BID) for 20 weeks with minimal relief
- Corticosteroid injections: 3 subacromial injections over 6 months, 
  temporary relief only (4-6 weeks duration each)
- Activity modification with persistent symptoms
- Home exercise program with resistance band training, documented compliance
- Ice therapy and anti-inflammatory modalities
- Work restrictions in place for 4 months due to pain

IMAGING STUDIES:
- X-ray right shoulder (8/1/2025): Reduced subacromial space, mild AC joint 
  arthritis, no fractures
- MRI right shoulder (8/5/2025): 
  * Full-thickness tear supraspinatus tendon, 2 cm retraction
  * Superior labral tear (SLAP lesion type II)
  * Moderate muscle atrophy of supraspinatus
  * Intact subscapularis and infraspinatus tendons
  * Moderate subacromial bursitis

FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS DOCUMENTED:
- Severe pain with overhead activities (8-9/10)
- Unable to perform job duties (administrative assistant, computer work)
- Difficulty with daily activities: reaching, lifting, dressing
- Night pain interrupting sleep 5-6 nights per week
- Inability to carry groceries or lift objects over 5 pounds
- Significant impact on quality of life per validated outcome scores:
  * ASES score: 35/100 (severe dysfunction)
  * QuickDASH: 68/100 (severe disability)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS:
- Positive painful arc test
- Positive Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign
- Positive Neer impingement sign
- Weakness with external rotation and abduction
- Limited active range of motion: forward flexion 110°, abduction 95°
- Positive O'Brien's test for SLAP lesion
- Tenderness to palpation over anterior and lateral acromion

MEDICAL CLEARANCE:
- Internal medicine clearance obtained (9/25/2025)
- Cardiac risk assessment: low risk
- Medical optimization completed
- No contraindications to surgery identified

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 75 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None intraoperative
DRAINS: None placed
TOURNIQUET: Not used

SPECIMENS: None sent to pathology

IMPLANTS USED:
- Two 4.5mm knotless suture anchors (medial row)
- Two 4.75mm knotless suture anchors (lateral row)
- Two 3.0mm knotless labral repair anchors

DISPOSITION: 
Patient tolerated all procedures well and was transferred to PACU in stable 
condition. Post-operative orders written including:
- Pain management protocol
- Immobilizer application
- Physical therapy protocol to begin at 2 weeks
- Follow-up instructions provided

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
- 2 weeks: Wound check, suture removal
- 6 weeks: Begin gentle active range of motion
- 12 weeks: Advance strengthening program
- 6 months: Return to full activities as tolerated

PROGNOSIS: Good with appropriate rehabilitation
