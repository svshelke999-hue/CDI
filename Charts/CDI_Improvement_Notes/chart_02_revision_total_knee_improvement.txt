PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Document reason for revision and component status in greater detail.
- Capture implant specifications and intraoperative cultures.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Failure Etiology: Clarify mechanical vs. infectious failure; specify loosening, wear patterns, or instability metrics.
2. Component Details: Record brand, size, constraint level, stem lengths, augments, and whether antibiotic cement was used.
3. Explanted Hardware: Note which components were removed and condition of bone stock.
4. Cultures/Pathology: Document whether synovial fluid or tissue samples were sent for culture/pathology, with preliminary results.
5. Blood Loss & Transfusion: Provide precise EBL and note if cell saver or transfusions were necessary.
6. Postoperative Plan: Outline DVT prophylaxis, weight-bearing restrictions, and rehab milestones.
7. Medical Necessity: Reference preoperative imaging and failed conservative measures or bracing.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 27487 with payer-required documentation for revision complexity.
- Detailed component data aids device charge capture and implant tracking compliance.
