CHART: chart_04_hip_labral_fai.txt

PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Quantify impingement morphology and traction metrics.
- Strengthen documentation supporting combined labral repair and femoroplasty.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Morphology Measurements: Add alpha angle, lateral center-edge angle, and head-neck offset values from imaging or intraoperative assessment.
2. Cartilage Grading: Document acetabular and femoral cartilage status using Outerbridge or Beck grading.
3. Traction Time: Record total traction duration and intervals to comply with operative standards.
4. Lesion Description: Describe labral tear extent in clock-face terms pre- and post-repair, including tissue quality.
5. Implants: List anchor brand/size and orientation (trans-osseous vs. knotted) for supply reconciliation.
6. Rehabilitation: Outline weight-bearing restrictions, brace settings, and specific therapy phases.
7. Conservative Care: Summarize prior injections, physical therapy, or activity modification attempts with timelines.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 29914 and 29916 when payer requests morphologic proof of impingement.
- Detailed traction and implant data reduce documentation queries and speed utilization review approval.
