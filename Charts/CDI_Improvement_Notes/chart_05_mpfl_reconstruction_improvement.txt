PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Specify graft selection and fixation technique.
- Provide objective instability metrics supporting reconstruction.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Graft Detail: Indicate whether autograft or allograft was used, harvest site, diameter, and preparation steps.
2. Imaging Metrics: Document trochlear dysplasia grade, TT-TG distance, patellar height (Caton-Deschamps), or MRI findings.
3. Fixation Hardware: List screw sizes, tunnel locations, and any suture anchors employed.
4. Conservative Therapy: Detail bracing, therapy, taping, and duration of non-operative management with outcomes.
5. Lateral Release Rationale: Clarify intraoperative findings prompting lateral release and extent performed.
6. Postoperative Protocol: Provide weight-bearing limitations, brace settings, and rehab progression.
7. Comorbid Considerations: Include BMI or connective tissue disorders influencing instability if applicable.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 27427 and adjunct release codes by demonstrating medical necessity.
- Thorough graft and hardware documentation aligns with payer implant tracking requirements.
