CHART: chart_06_biceps_tenodesis.txt

PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Capture implant specifics and concomitant pathology findings.
- Enhance documentation of conservative care and postoperative directives.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Implant Detail: Record screw size, manufacturer, and fixation position (suprapectoral vs. subpectoral) for supply billing.
2. Conservative Measures: Outline physical therapy duration, medication trials, and injection history supporting failure of non-operative care.
3. Tendon Pathology: Describe degree of tendon degeneration, partial tearing, or groove osteophytes to justify tenodesis.
4. Subacromial Findings: Document bursal thickness, spur removal, and AC joint status if addressed.
5. Blood Loss & Fluids: Provide quantitative EBL and mention irrigation volumes if significant.
6. Rehabilitation Plan: Define sling duration, activity restrictions, and therapy start date with goals.
7. Risk/Comorbidity: Include diabetes, smoking status, or other factors impacting healing if present.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 29828 and 29826 by aligning with payer criteria for failed conservative management and implant use.
- Precise implant documentation prevents supply denials.
