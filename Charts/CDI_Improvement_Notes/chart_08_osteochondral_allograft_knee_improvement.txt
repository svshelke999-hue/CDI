PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Provide lesion measurements and donor graft identifiers.
- Clarify prior treatment failure justification.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Lesion Description: Document defect dimensions (length, width, depth) and location referencing clock-face or grid mapping.
2. Donor Information: Record graft lot number, procurement source, and expiration to meet tissue tracking standards.
3. Prior Procedures: Detail the previous microfracture (date, outcome) and other conservative measures such as injections or bracing.
4. Cartilage Grading: Include Outerbridge grade and subchondral bone status.
5. Fixation Technique: Note whether press-fit alone or adjunct fixation (screws/pins) was used.
6. Blood Loss/Fluids: Provide precise EBL and whether tourniquet pressure/time met institutional protocols.
7. Rehabilitation Plan: Outline weight-bearing progression, CPM duration, and restrictions to support medical necessity.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 27415 or 29867 depending on approach; lesion metrics assist payer authorization.
- Donor documentation satisfies regulatory tissue-tracking requirements.
