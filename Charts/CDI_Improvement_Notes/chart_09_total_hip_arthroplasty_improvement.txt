PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Detail implant specifications and alignment metrics.
- Clarify perioperative management plans.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Implant Specifics: Record cup size, liner type, femoral stem size/offset, head diameter, and bearing surface material.
2. Alignment Data: Document cup abduction and anteversion angles plus leg length/offset restoration measurements.
3. Blood Loss & Transfusion: Provide precise EBL, cell saver usage, and transfusion status.
4. DVT Prophylaxis: State chosen regimen (medication, duration, mechanical devices) instead of "pending."
5. Comorbidities & Risk: Mention BMI, diabetes, cardiovascular history, or other factors influencing outcomes.
6. Pathology/Cultures: Note whether femoral head sent for pathology or cultures.
7. Postoperative Course: Outline weight-bearing orders, hip precautions, and rehab timeline.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 27130 and assists with DRG assignment by confirming implant type and perioperative planning.
- Detailed prophylaxis documentation helps meet quality program requirements.
