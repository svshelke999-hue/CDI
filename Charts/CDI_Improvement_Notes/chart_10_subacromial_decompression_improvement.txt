CHART: chart_10_subacromial_decompression.txt

PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Enhance description of decompression work and conservative management failure.
- Add objective pain and functional data.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Acromioplasty Detail: Document millimeters of bone resected, instrumentation, and whether coracoacromial ligament was partially released.
2. Rotator Cuff Assessment: Clarify depth of partial tear (Ellman grade) and any debridement percentage.
3. Conservative Therapy: Outline physical therapy duration, corticosteroid injections, and medication trials with dates/results.
4. Imaging: Include MRI/X-ray findings confirming impingement anatomy (acromial morphology, bursal thickening).
5. Pain/Function Scores: Add preoperative pain scale and functional limitations to support medical necessity.
6. Blood Loss: Provide exact EBL and fluid balance.
7. Rehab Plan: State therapy start date, frequency, and activity restrictions.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 29826 and 29822 by documenting acromial resection and cuff debridement extent.
- Clear conservative failure rationale reduces payer denials for arthroscopic decompression.
