CHART: chart_07_reverse_shoulder_arthroplasty.txt

PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Clarify indications for reverse configuration and implant specifics.
- Improve perioperative detail for quality and registry reporting.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Indication Detail: Document rotator cuff status (tears, fatty infiltration grades) and range-of-motion deficits that necessitate reverse arthroplasty.
2. Implant Inventory: Specify baseplate size, screw lengths, glenosphere diameter, humeral stem size, and polyethylene thickness.
3. Bone Quality: Note glenoid bone stock, need for augments, and any grafting performed.
4. Blood Loss: Provide quantitative EBL and whether tranexamic acid or cell saver was used.
5. Neurovascular Assessment: Document brachial plexus or axillary nerve status pre- and post-implantation.
6. Comorbidities: Mention osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or prior surgeries influencing complexity.
7. Postoperative Plan: Detail sling type, duration, therapy milestones, and DVT prophylaxis.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 23472 with payer-required documentation of indications.
- Implant specificity aligns with device registry and charge capture requirements.
