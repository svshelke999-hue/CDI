PRIMARY CDI FOCUS:
- Identify graft source/type and fixation method.
- Detail meniscal pathology and treatment extent.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Graft Documentation: Specify whether autograft or allograft was used, source (hamstring, patellar tendon, tibialis, etc.), and preparation technique.
2. Tunnel Data: Include tunnel diameters, positions, and guidance system used to support appropriate implant selection.
3. Meniscectomy Detail: Describe percentage of meniscus removed, zones involved, and remaining rim stability.
4. Imaging History: Summarize MRI findings and pivot shift testing results preoperatively for medical necessity.
5. Rehab Orders: Clarify brace settings, weight-bearing restrictions, and therapy timeline (phased protocol).
6. Concomitant Findings: Document cartilage status and any addressed chondral lesions or ACL remnant handling.

CODING IMPACT:
- Supports CPT 29888 and 29881 with comprehensive documentation.
- Detailed graft description protects against medical necessity denials and assists billing for implant supply charges.
