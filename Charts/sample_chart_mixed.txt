OPERATIVE REPORT

Patient Name: John Doe
MRN: 123456789
Date of Service: October 16, 2025
Surgeon: Dr. Jane Smith, MD

CPT CODES: 27447, 29826

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Total knee arthroplasty, right knee
2. Subacromial decompression, left shoulder
3. Diagnostic arthroscopy, left knee
4. Arthroscopic meniscectomy, medial meniscus

INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with severe osteoarthritis of the right knee and 
rotator cuff pathology of the left shoulder. He has failed conservative management 
for over 12 weeks including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe osteoarthritis, right knee
2. Rotator cuff syndrome with impingement, left shoulder
3. Meniscal tear, left knee medial meniscus
4. Chronic knee pain, left knee

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as above

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:

RIGHT KNEE - TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY (CPT 27447):
After proper informed consent and surgical timeout, the patient was brought to the 
operating room and placed in supine position. General anesthesia was administered. 
The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.

A midline incision was made over the right knee. The joint was exposed through a 
medial parapatellar approach. Severe arthritic changes were noted with complete 
loss of joint space and exposed bone on bone contact. Osteophytes were removed.

The femoral and tibial cuts were made using measured resection technique with 
appropriate alignment guides. Trial components were placed and range of motion 
was assessed. Final cemented components were implanted with good fixation.

The wound was irrigated copiously. Hemostasis was achieved. The arthrotomy was 
closed in layers. Sterile dressing was applied.

LEFT SHOULDER - SUBACROMIAL DECOMPRESSION (CPT 29826):
The patient was repositioned to beach chair position. The left shoulder was 
prepped and draped in sterile fashion.

Standard posterior and anterior portals were established. Diagnostic arthroscopy 
revealed rotator cuff fraying but no complete tears. Subacromial space showed 
significant impingement with bursal thickening.

Subacromial decompression was performed with removal of anterior acromial spur 
and resection of inflamed bursal tissue. The coracoacromial ligament was released. 
Final arthroscopic inspection showed improved subacromial space.

LEFT KNEE - DIAGNOSTIC ARTHROSCOPY AND MENISCECTOMY:
Standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals were established. Diagnostic 
arthroscopy revealed a complex tear of the medial meniscus. The lateral meniscus 
and ACL were intact.

Arthroscopic meniscectomy was performed with removal of the torn medial meniscus 
fragment. The remaining meniscus was contoured and stable. Joint was irrigated.

CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT HISTORY:
- Physical therapy: 16 weeks (documented sessions from 6/1/2025 to 9/15/2025)
- Medications: NSAIDs (ibuprofen 800mg TID) for 14 weeks, minimal relief
- Corticosteroid injections: Right knee (2 injections, temporary relief only)
- Activity modification attempted with persistent symptoms
- Home exercise program compliance documented

IMAGING STUDIES:
- X-ray right knee (9/1/2025): Severe tricompartmental arthritis, bone-on-bone 
  contact medial compartment, large osteophytes
- MRI right knee (9/5/2025): Complete cartilage loss, subchondral edema, meniscal 
  degeneration
- X-ray left shoulder (8/15/2025): Acromial spur, reduced subacromial space
- MRI left shoulder (8/20/2025): Rotator cuff tendinosis, subacromial bursitis, 
  no complete tears

FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS DOCUMENTED:
- Unable to climb stairs without severe pain (10/10)
- Difficulty with activities of daily living (dressing, bathing)
- Interrupted sleep due to knee pain
- Limited shoulder range of motion affecting overhead activities
- Unable to work as construction worker for past 3 months

MEDICAL CLEARANCE:
- Cardiology clearance obtained (9/20/2025)
- Medical optimization completed
- Risk assessment documented and discussed with patient

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 200 mL
COMPLICATIONS: None
DRAINS: None placed
TOURNIQUET TIME: 65 minutes (right knee)

DISPOSITION: Patient tolerated procedure well and was transferred to PACU in 
stable condition. Post-operative orders written. Physical therapy to begin 
post-operative day 1.

FOLLOW-UP: Scheduled for 2 weeks post-operative, then 6 weeks, 12 weeks for 
clinical and radiographic assessment.
