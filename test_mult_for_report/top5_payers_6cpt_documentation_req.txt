  * Extent of debridement performed on each structure
  * Any additional procedures performed during the same operative session
- Medical records supporting medical necessity, which may include:
  * History and physical examination findings
  * Prior conservative treatments attempted and their outcomes
  * Imaging study results (e.g., MRI, X-ray) documenting shoulder pathology
  * Functional limitations caused by the shoulder condition
  * Pain levels and impact on activities of daily living
- If other procedures are performed during the same operative session (e.g., rotator cuff 
  repair, biceps tenodesis, subacromial decompression), clear documentation distinguishing 
  which structures were debrided versus which structures underwent other procedures is 
  essential for proper coding
- Documentation must clearly establish that three or more discrete structures were debrided 
  to support the use of CPT 29823 rather than CPT 29822 (limited debridement of one or two 
  discrete structures)
- Any structures that undergo a separate procedure (e.g., repair) during the same operative 
  session cannot be counted toward the three structures required for CPT 29823

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION:
- Not explicitly stated in policy documents; providers should check the member's specific 
  benefit plan document

CPT 29826 - SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPY, SURGICAL; DECOMPRESSION OF SUBACROMIAL SPACE 
           WITH PARTIAL ACROMIOPLASTY
================================================================================


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:

For Commercial Plans:
- Medical records documentation may be required to assess whether the member meets the 
  clinical criteria for coverage but does not guarantee coverage of the service requested
- When documentation is requested for review, providers should refer to the guidelines 
  titled "Medical Records Documentation Used for Reviews"


================================================================================
CPT 29827 - ARTHROSCOPIC ROTATOR CUFF REPAIR
================================================================================

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:

For All Plans:
- Medical records documentation may be required to assess whether the member meets the 
  clinical criteria for coverage but does not guarantee coverage of the service requested
- Documentation should include:
  * History and physical examination findings
  * Description of functional limitations
  * Results of diagnostic imaging confirming rotator cuff tear
  * Documentation of failed conservative treatment
  * Operative report detailing the procedure performed
  * For cases requiring extensive debridement (29823) in addition to rotator cuff repair 
    (29827), documentation must clearly indicate that the debridement was performed in a 
    different area of the same shoulder

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION:
- Varies by specific plan
- When prior authorization is required, the following information should be submitted:
  * Clinical documentation supporting medical necessity
  * Imaging studies confirming rotator cuff tear
  * Documentation of failed conservative treatment
  * Proposed treatment plan


================================================================================
CPT 73721 - MRI LOWER EXTREMITY (NO CONTRAST)
================================================================================

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:

For Commercial Plans:
- Current clinical evaluation including:
  * Detailed history of the specific condition requiring imaging
  * Physical examination findings related to the requested imaging
  * Results of x-rays or other prior imaging studies related to the current condition
  * Details of conservative treatment tried and failed (when applicable)
  * For trauma cases: mechanism of injury, timing, and severity
  * For suspected infection: presence of fever, elevated inflammatory markers, or other signs 
    of infection
  * For suspected tumors: presence of pain, swelling, or other concerning symptoms
  * For joint disorders: details of pain, limited range of motion, instability, or mechanical 
    symptoms
- For hospital outpatient department MRI requests, documentation must include:
  * Specific reason why the procedure cannot be performed at a freestanding imaging center
  * For claustrophobia/anxiety: documentation of diagnosis and need for open MRI
  * For size accommodation issues: documentation of patient size and equipment limitations
  * For sedation needs: documentation of why moderate or deep sedation is required
- For pediatric patients:
  * Growth and developmental history when relevant
  * For limping child: duration of symptoms, presence of fever, history of trauma
  * For DDH: results of physical examination and ultrasound findings
  * For AVN: risk factors and results of x-rays
  * For SCFE: results of x-rays and risk factors
  * For inflammatory conditions: results of laboratory tests and joint examination
