CDI Expert Review Report (AI “Improved Chart” vs Medical Record Evidence)
Folder: test_mult_for_report/2
Prepared: 2026-02-02

Scope / Files Reviewed
- 1) 2.txt (AI “improved” pre-operative note with placeholders)
- 2) multi_chart_1769771550_20260130_164230_numbered_chart.txt (raw medical record text: pre-op note + operative note)
- 3) multi_chart_1769771549_20260130_164230.json (raw AI output with structured “improvements”, “user_input_required”, and “recommendations”)

Case synopsis (record-based)
- 60-year-old female with history of Left TKA (June 2025).
- Presents with acute onset (4 days) of left knee pain/swelling/large effusion; aspiration consistent with acute infection.
- Assessment in record: “acute hematogenous infection of left total knee” (<1 week symptoms) with active foot ulcers + UTI as possible sources.
- Operative management: Left total knee revision arthroplasty (single-component revision / polyethylene exchange) + incisional negative pressure wound therapy.

Method (how the “test” was done)
- Extracted AI-changes and suggestions from:
  - 2.txt tags: [AI ADDED], [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED]
  - JSON: enhanced_by_ai.improvements, enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required, enhanced_by_ai.recommendations
- Cross-checked each recommendation/suggestion against the raw record text to label:
  - PRESENT (already documented),
  - PARTIAL (some elements present but incomplete),
  - MISSING (not found / needs clarification).

Key CDI finding (high-signal)
- Many “physician input required” prompts in 2.txt are already supported by the raw record (vitals, exam, imaging, aspiration cell count/differential/gram stain, operative details).
- The primary true documentation gaps are: final organism identification + sensitivities, detailed wound (foot) characterization, and a clearer linkage between “antibiotics tried” and the decision for urgent surgery.

================================================================================
Section A — “AI Added” improvements (what the AI changed/added)
Source: JSON → enhanced_by_ai.improvements (and visible in 2.txt)

1) Structure / headers / clinical flow
- AI-added: Added clear section headers and organized content in a logical flow.
- Evidence check: NOT APPLICABLE (formatting change).

2) Chief complaint added
- AI-added: “Left knee pain and swelling with suspected prosthetic joint infection…”
- Evidence check: PRESENT (HPI and assessment support this complaint).

3) Diagnosis line added (with organism placeholder)
- AI-added: “Acute hematogenous infection of left total knee prosthesis … [organism]”
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: acute hematogenous infection/PJI wording is explicitly documented.
  - MISSING: specific organism name (culture result organism) and sensitivities are not shown in provided record text.

4) Past surgical history enhanced
- AI-added: ensured “Left total knee arthroplasty (June 2025)” appears clearly.
- Evidence check: PRESENT (raw HPI/operative note state June 2025).

5) Lab interpretation added (WBC/ESR/CRP “consistent with infection”)
- AI-added: interpretive language.
- Evidence check: PRESENT in data (ESR 67, CRP 24.5, WBC ~11) and clinically consistent; interpretation is editorial.

6) Assessment/Plan + Medical necessity header
- AI-added: explicit “assessment/plan” and “medical necessity” sections with prompts.
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT in record: aspiration highly inflammatory; gram stain positive; culture positive; ID consulted; surgical decision documented.
  - MISSING/UNCLEAR: “failed conservative management with IV antibiotics” is implied but not clearly documented as a failed trial prior to surgery (given acute PJI, surgery may be indicated urgently rather than after failure).

================================================================================
Section B — Physician-input suggestions (AI prompts) + evidence check
Sources:
- 2.txt [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: …]

- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: swollen knee, slight erythema, nontender, no drainage/open wounds; vitals and general/system exam.
  - MISSING: ROM degrees, stability exam, quantified effusion, pain with passive motion specifics.

6) Detailed foot wound exam (location/size/depth/characteristics)
- AI prompt: detailed wound assessment.
- Evidence check: MISSING (record notes dressings/Betadine but not wound measurements/description).

7) Social history (smoking status, alcohol use, living situation, occupation)
- AI prompt: document social history.
- Evidence check: MISSING in provided excerpts (PMH notes “history of ETOH abuse” but not current use; no smoking/living/occupation documented here).

8) Home medication list with doses/frequency
- AI prompt: complete home meds list.
- Evidence check: MISSING/NOT SHOWN as a distinct “home meds” list (facility-administered meds shown).

9) Negative pressure wound therapy details (device/settings/indication)
- AI prompt: device/settings/indication.
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: operative note documents incisional wound vac (PICO) and Prevena x 7 days.
  - MISSING: settings (pressure), and explicit indication language beyond “concern for poor wound healing” (benefits could be stated more explicitly if needed for payer/coding).

10) Failed conservative management (antibiotics) before surgery
- AI prompt: details of conservative treatment attempted and “failure”.
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: patient was on antibiotics for foot infection and UTI; admitted and IV antibiotics initiated; ID consulted.

11) Informed consent documentation
- AI prompt: explicit consent language.
- Evidence check: PRESENT (operative note documents informed consent obtained; pre-op note documents risks/benefits discussion and decision to proceed).

12) Post-op rehab plan + DVT/antibiotic plan details

  - PRESENT: WBAT; DVT prophylaxis to be started; discharge after PT goals met; antibiotic plan to be finalized; follow cultures.
  - MISSING: specific antibiotic regimen/duration in orthopedics note (likely in ID note not included here).

================================================================================
Section C — AI “recommendations” (JSON recommendations array) + evidence check
Source: JSON → enhanced_by_ai.recommendations

1) Document diagnostic criteria for PJI (markers + aspiration + presentation) (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PRESENT
  - ESR/CRP elevated; aspiration 88k WBC / 94% neutrophils; gram stain positive; acute pain/swelling/effusion documented.
- CDI note: organism + sensitivities still missing in this note set.

2) Specify single-component vs multi-component revision (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PRESENT (operative note: “single-component revision”; polyethylene exchange described).

3) Document failure of conservative management (antibiotics) before surgery (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (antibiotics were started, but “failure” is not clearly documented; acute PJI often warrants urgent DAIR/poly exchange rather than waiting for failure).

4) Document indications for NPWT (wound characteristics and expected benefits) (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (reason given: concern for poor wound healing; device/duration documented).

5) Document impact of Charcot foot + ulcerations on plan/prognosis (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: foot ulcers and UTI noted as possible hematogenous sources; wounds dressed.
  - MISSING: detailed wound status/severity and how it alters prognosis/disposition/antibiotic strategy.

================================================================================
Section D — CDI expert opinion: additional opportunities in this case

1) Clarify diagnosis terminology consistency: “PJI” vs “acute hematogenous periprosthetic infection”
- Opportunity: ensure consistent phrasing across pre-op and op note; include laterality and joint (left knee) consistently.

2) Capture organism and sensitivities (high yield)
- Opportunity: add organism name (e.g., staph aureus, strep species, etc.) and sensitivities when available; links to ID plan and antibiotic duration.

3) Explicitly document surgical strategy rationale for acute hematogenous PJI
- Opportunity: document why modular poly exchange with implant retention is appropriate (acute timing, stable implants, no osteolysis, purulence).
- Evidence: operative note states implants well fixed/no osteolysis and intra-articular purulence—this supports DAIR/liner exchange rationale.

4) Wound documentation for foot ulcers
- Opportunity: include location/size/depth/drainage/ischemia/neuropathy status; helps source-control narrative and supports complexity of care.

5) Antibiotic plan specifics and coordination with ID
- Opportunity: document planned duration (IV vs oral), targeted therapy based on cultures, and follow-up monitoring.

================================================================================
Section E — Suggested compliant CDI query list (record-grounded)

1) Organism + sensitivities
- Query: Please document the organism identified from knee aspiration/intra-op cultures and antibiotic sensitivities (if available).

2) Knee aspiration culture finalization
- Query: Please document final culture results (organism, number of positive cultures) and whether this meets institutional/MSIS criteria for PJI.

3) Clarify procedure type for coding
- Query: Please confirm revision type: single-component revision (polyethylene liner exchange only) with retention of femoral/tibial/patellar components.

4) Foot wound specifics (potential source)
- Query: Please document foot wound details (location, size, depth, drainage, surrounding erythema/cellulitis) and current management plan.

5) Antibiotic strategy + duration
- Query: Please document the antibiotic plan (agents and planned duration of IV/oral therapy) per ID, and rationale.

6) NPWT rationale
- Query: Please document indication for incisional NPWT (e.g., high-risk wound, poor soft tissue, infection risk reduction) and planned settings if required by facility/payer.

Bottom line
- AI-added changes mostly improve structure and highlight missing specifics.
- In this record set, many “missing” items are already documented (imaging, labs, aspiration data, operative details, consent).
- True high-yield CDI gaps: organism/sensitivities, detailed foot wound documentation, and clearer statement of medical decision-making regarding antibiotics vs urgent DAIR/liner exchange.
