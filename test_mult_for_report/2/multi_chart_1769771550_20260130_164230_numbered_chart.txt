L012: HPI: The patient is a 60 y.o. female with history of Left total knee replacement. The patient did well and was
L013: recovering quickly from her left knee replacement performed in June 2025.
L014: 
L015: Separately, she has a history of lower extremity neuropathy leading to Charcot feet. She has had numerous foot
L016: procedures to correct midfoot deformities
L017: 
L018: Due to her Charcot foot arthropathy she has been dealing with ulcerations and foot infections over the years.
L019: Recently, they had been well managed prior to the knee replacement.
L020: 
L021: More recently, she began to have worsening of her foot issues; followed by Dr Pao and wound care; she had
L022: infection and purulence, which was cultured and she was placed on antibiotics recently. Separately, she also had
L023: been on antibiotics for a UTI.
L024: 
L025: 4 days ago she had acute onset of left knee pain and severe swelling. Prior to this she was doing well with the knee
L026: replacement surgery. This was progressive and painful and she had a large effusion. She was sent to the GH ED
L027: yesterday where she had elevated inflammatory markers, the knee was aspirated and was consistent with acute
L028: infection with a highly inflammatory white blood cell count, and there was a positive culture.
L029: 
L030: She was admitted and IV antibiotics were initiated after the organism was identified. Dr Rossi from ID was consulted.
L031: ROS: As above.

L449: More recently, she began to have worsening of her foot issues; followed by Dr Pao and wound care; she had
L450: infection and purulence, which was cultured and she was placed on antibiotics recently. Separately, she also had
L451: been on antibiotics for a UTI.
L452: 
L453: 4 days ago she had acute onset of left knee pain and severe swelling. Prior to this she was doing well with the knee
L454: replacement surgery. This was progressive and painful and she had a large effusion. She was sent to the GH ED
L455: yesterday where she had elevated inflammatory markers, the knee was aspirated and was consistent with acute
L456: infection with a highly inflammatory white blood cell count, and there was a positive culture.

L461: She was admitted and IV antibiotics were initiated after the organism was identified. Dr Rossi from ID was consulted.
L462: 
L463: After careful discussion of the risks and benefits of the surgery, including the potential complications of deep venous
L464: thrombosis, infection, nerve or blood vessel injury, ligament injury, fracture, incomplete resolution of pain, continued
L465: deformity, loss of range of motion and stiffness, and the complications associated with anesthesia, the patient has
L466: decided that they would like to proceed with revision left knee replacement. Due to acute hematogenous nature of
L467: the infection, we determined that modular exchange/revision of the polyethylene would be appropriate with retention
L468: of the other implants.
L469: 
L470: Description of procedure:
L471: 
L472: The patient was met in the preoperative area, and again the associated risks of the surgery were discussed with the
L473: patient. Informed consent was obtained. The operative site was marked. The patient was transferred to the operating
L474: room. A spinal anesthetic was performed prior to the procedure. The patient received preoperative antibiotics within
L475: 30 minutes prior to the incision, and tranexamic acid intravenously. Tranexamic acid was also given at the end of the
L476: case. Prior to incision a surgical time out was performed to confirm patient identification, and laterality.
L477: 
L478: Prior to the incision, we repeated aspiration under sterile conditions. 50cc of purulent fluid was aspirated and sent for
L479: culture.
L480: 
L481: A longitudinal incision was made, centered over the anterior aspect of the knee. Soft tissue was dissected sharply
L482: down to the extensor mechanism. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed to expose the knee joint.
L483: 
L484: Soft tissue was elevated off the proximal medial tibia for exposure. Infrapatellar fat pad was excised. The patella was
L485: subluxed laterally.
L486: 
L487: Swabs were taken and sent for microbiology.
L488: 
L489: Complete synovectomy was performed using electrocautery, curette, cobb and rongeur. We were careful to remove
L490: synovium from the lateral gutters, supra patellar pouch, and the posterior capsule.
L491: 
L492: Using an osteotome and forcep, we were able to remove the tibial polyethylene without disrupting the tibial
L493: component fixation. We then probed the implant/cement/bone interfaces of the femur, tibia and patellar button--
L494: which were stable.
L495: 
L496: Full mechanical debridement undertaken throughout the joint including rongeur, curette, and bovie.
L497: 
L498: Following the synovectomy, we then performed mechanical disruption of biofilm with sponges, scrub brushes and
L499: pulsatile lavage. A series of anti microbial fluids were irrigated through the knee including NS with Ancef, Irrisept,
L500: Bactisure, and Surgiphor (betadine). Soft and hard brushes used to disrupt any potential biofilm on the implants.
L501: 
L502: We then placed a sterile cover on the knee and removed all dirty drapes gowns and gloves.
L503: An entirely sterile new setup was utilized. All surgical staff re-prepped and draped in order to ensure sterility.
L504: 
L505: We then repeated our debridement and then repeated the full irrigation protocol. In total, approximtely 20L of fluid
L506: was irrigated through the knee.
L507: 
L508: We then trialed and implanted the appropriate tibial polyethylene. The knee was taken through a full range of motion,
L509: with excellent extension, flexion, and coronal plane balance. A 13mm medial congruent PE liner was implanted.
L510: 
L511: 2g of Ancef and 2g of vancomycin powder was then placed into the deep wound.
L512: 
L513: At this point we began our closure. The arthrotomy was then closed with monofilament barbed suture; followed by
L514: monofilament deep fatty layer closure, followed by a running #2 PDO barbed suture for the superficial tissues.
L515: Staples were utilized for skin closure. Due to concern for poor wound healing, an incisional wound vac (PICO) was
L516: utilized to accelerate skin healing and reduce risk for infection. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was
L517: transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
L518: 
L519: Post-operative Plan:
L520: 
L521: The patient be allowed to weight-bear as tolerated.
L522: 
L523: They will receive post-operative antibiotics and be started on DVT prophylaxis.
L524: 
L525: Follow up pre and intra-operative cultures
L526: 
L527: Prevena wound vac x 7 days
L528: 
L529: Staples out in 14 days
L530: 
L531: They will be discharged home from the hospital when they are comfortable and have met all PT goals and antibiotic
L532: plan is finalized.
