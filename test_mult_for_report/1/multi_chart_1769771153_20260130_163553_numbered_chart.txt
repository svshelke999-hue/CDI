L518: XR AP pelvis + femur demonstrates Left intertrochanteric hip fracture
L519: 
L520: Impression and plan:
L521: 
L522: Patricia H Barrie is a 76 y.o. female sustained a left intertrochanteric hip fracture. Femur fractures in the elderly are of
L523: the highest severity due to the morbidity without treatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of
L524: ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications causing death. Therefore | had a long discussion with the
L525: patient and their family about the treatment options, including nonoperative and operative intervention. We
L526: discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to fixation as well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. After
L527: going over these options, we decided to pursue left hip ORIF with a cephalomedullary nail.
L528: 
L529: We discussed the risks of surgery including infection, wound complications, bleeding, need for a transfusion, possible
L530: damage to surronding neurovascular structures, potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain
L531: and worsening weakness, stiffness, instability/dislocation, limb length discrepancy, fracture, infection requiring the
L532: resection or revision, component loosening or cutout and the need for conversion surgery in the future. We also
L533: discussed the risks of thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart attack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary
L534: edema, fat/cement embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia and nerve blocks.
L535: 
L536: Awaiting primary medical service optimization and clearance. Would favor spinal anesthesia and early care as delay
L537: in care results in perioperative morbidity and mortality with geriatric femur fractures.

L667: Indication:
L668: 
L669: The patient is a 76 y.o. female with past medical history of htn, hld, hypothy, colon ca who suffered a mechanical fall
L670: on 11/9/25. The patient was brought to the Greenwich Hospital Emergency Room, where they were found to have a
L671: left hip pertrochanteric femur fracture. The patient uses no assistive device for ambulating at baseline. She has a
L672: prior right hip replacement and left knee replacement at HSS a few years ago.
L673: 
L674: | had a long discussion with the patient and family regarding treatment options for her left proximal femur fracture,
L675: and | did recommend surgical repair. We discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives. Nonoperative treatment will
L676: result in prolonged recumbency, non-weight bearing to the right lower extremity, and potentially bedsores, DVT,
L677: pneumonia, persistent pain, limited mobility, displacement of fracture, fracture non-union, fracture malunion, or
L678: deformity. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include, but not limited
L679: to, pain, bleeding, stiffness, infection, damage to nearby structures, blood vessel injury, nerve injury, tendon injury,
L680: failure of fixation, hardware failure, hardware complications, soft tissue irritation secondary to hardware, peri-implant
L681: fractures, fracture non-union, fracture malunion, fracture displacement, limb deformity, scar formation, post-traumatic
L682: arthritis, the need for additional surgery, thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart attack, cardiac event, heart

L688: failure, pulmonary edema, fat embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia. The potential benefits of
L689: surgery are pain relief or improvement, fracture stability, improved mobility, and allowance of immediate weight
L690: bearing post-operatively. We did discuss that we may need to perform an open reduction of the fracture to manually
L691: manipulate the fracture fragments, in order to improve the alignment of the fracture prior to internal fixation. The
L692: patient expressed understanding and elected to proceed with operative fixation of the left proximal femur fracture with
L693: a cephalomedullary nail.
L694: 
L695: We also discussed the overall poor prognosis for patients who have suffered a femur fracture, with high morbidity and
L696: mortality rates following this particular pattern of injury. The patient and family expressed understanding and elected
L697: to proceed with operative fixation of the proximal femur fracture.
L698: 
L699: The patient was seen by the Medicine service and was determined to be optimized from a medical standpoint for this
L700: surgery. The medicine team cleared the patient for surgery as well.
L701: 
L702: Procedure:
L703: 
L704: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful induction of general anesthesia, a closed
L705: reduction was performed. Flouroscopy was used to confirm that the reduction was within acceptable parameters. The
L706: left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with the patient in the supine position
L707: on the fracture table. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered within 30 minutes prior to the procedure as well as 1
L708: gram of tranexamic acid. A time out was performed by all members of the surgical team confirming patient identity
L709: and surgical site laterality.
L710: 
L711: A lateral incision was made proximal to, and in-line with, the femur. The entry guidewire was then advanced onto the
L712: appropriate start site on the greater trochanter. This was confirmed with intraoperative flouroscopy on both the AP
L713: and lateral views. The guidewire was then advanced with power into the intramedullary canal. Again flouroscopy was
L714: used to confirm that the entry guidewire was in the appropriate position. The entry reamer was then used through the
L715: soft tissue protector canula. Flouroscopy was used to confirm appropriate position of the entry reamer within the
L716: intramedullary canal and that it had been advanced to a sufficient depth. The reamer and entry guidewire were then
L717: removed.
L718: 
L719: The nail was then carefully advanced over the guidewire. During advancement of the nail, all reduction maneuvers
L720: were employed to maintain the reduction during insertion of the nail. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the
L721: nail had been advanced to the appropriate depth. The long guidewire was then removed. An incision was made over
L722: the lateral aspect of the thigh and the cannula for the lag screw was advanced until it made contact with the lateral
L723: cortical bone. Using flouroscopic guidance, the guidewire for the lag screw was then inserted and confirmed to be in
L724: appropriate position with the guidwire center-center on AP and lateral views of the femoral head. The depth of the
L725: guidewire was then measured and the 90 mm left threaded lag screw selected. The guidewire was then overdrilled
L726: and tapped for the screw of the appropriate depth. The lag screw was then inserted to the appropriate depth which
L727: again confirmed using flouroscopy.
L728: 
L729: We then turned our attention to insertion of the distal interlocking screw. A small incision was made over the lateral
L730: thigh in line with the cannula for the distal interlocking screw. The cannula was then advanced through the incision
L731: and down to bone. The drill was then carefully advanced and the depth of the interlocking screw measured off of the
L732: drill at 38mm. The screw of appropriate length was then inserted. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the
L733: screws were in appropriate position.
L734: 
L735: The wounds were then copiously irrigated. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl suture. The deep
L736: subcutaneous layers were closed with interrupted 0 vicryl and the dermal layer with 3-0 vicryl. The skin was then
L737: closed with staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and the patient was awaken from anesthesia. The patient
L738: was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. All sponge and instrument counts were correct.
L739: 
L740: Arthrex short nail implant system was used for this procedure
L741: 
L742: Postop Plan
L743: 
L744: The patient will be WBAT. DVT prophylaxis will be started with asa 81bid the morning of POD1; additional DVT
L745: prophylaxis will include SCDs, compression stockings, progressive mobilization. They will receive 24 hours of
L746: postoperative antibiotics. The patient will be discharged from the hospital when they are medically stable, have met
L747: all PT goals, and their pain is well controlled with oral analgesia.
