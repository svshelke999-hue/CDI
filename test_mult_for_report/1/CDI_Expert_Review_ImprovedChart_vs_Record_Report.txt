CDI Expert Review Report (AI “Improved Chart” vs Medical Record Evidence)
Folder: test_mult_for_report/1
Prepared: 2026-02-02

Scope / Files Reviewed
- 1) 1.txt  (AI “improved” orthopedic consultation note with placeholders)
- 2) multi_chart_1769771153_20260130_163553_numbered_chart.txt (raw medical record text: consultation note + operative note)
- 3) multi_chart_1769771153_20260130_163553.json (raw AI output with structured “improvements”, “user_input_required”, and “recommendations”)

Patient context (de-identified summary from record)
- 76-year-old female with mechanical fall on/around 11/09/2025.
- Diagnosis: Left intertrochanteric femur/hip fracture.
- Baseline: ambulates without assistive device.
- Plan/Procedure: Left hip ORIF with cephalomedullary nail; operative note documents intramedullary nailing on 11/10/2025.

How this was tested (method)
- Extracted “AI-added improvements” and “recommendations / physician input required” from:
  - 1.txt (tags: [AI ADDED], [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED])
  - JSON: enhanced_by_ai.improvements, enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required, enhanced_by_ai.recommendations
- Cross-checked each item against the raw chart text in multi_chart_..._numbered_chart.txt to determine:
  - PRESENT in record (already documented), or
  - PARTIAL (some elements present but not complete), or
  - MISSING (not found / needs clarification).

Key finding (high-signal)
- The AI “improved chart” in 1.txt flags multiple items as “physician input required” that ARE actually present in the raw medical record.
  - This means the “improved chart” behaves partly like a documentation template, not a reliable gap-detection output unless it is fully grounded to the source record.

================================================================================
Section A — “AI Added” improvements (what the AI changed/added)
Source: multi_chart_...json → enhanced_by_ai.improvements (+ visible tags in 1.txt)

1) Organization / formatting (section headers, structured layout)
- AI-added improvement: Added clear section headers and organized content into logical clinical sections.
- Record support check: NOT APPLICABLE (formatting change; does not require evidence).

2) Abbreviation expansion / clarity in HPI
- AI-added improvement: Expanded abbreviations (e.g., “htn/hld/predm”) to full terms.
- Record support check: PRESENT (underlying conditions listed in raw chart; expansion is editorial).

3) Medical necessity narrative section (AI-added “medical necessity documentation”)
- AI-added improvement: Added a structured medical necessity section (e.g., inability to ambulate, morbidity/mortality risk).
- Record support check: MOSTLY PRESENT in record already (raw consult note includes strong narrative about morbidity/mortality, inability to ambulate, baseline independence).
- CDI comment: Adding an explicit “medical necessity” header can help payer readability, but it must not introduce facts not present (e.g., “displaced” if only documented elsewhere).

4) Physical exam reformatting + clinical correlation
- AI-added improvement: Reformatted LLE exam and added correlation “consistent with intertrochanteric hip fracture”.
- Record support check: PRESENT (raw consult note documents “skin intact, leg shortened/externally rotated” and full NV exam).

5) Surgical planning section expansion (template fields)
- AI-added improvement: Added structured surgical plan fields (timing/anesthesia/LOS/rehab).
- Record support check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT in record: procedure decision (ORIF with cephalomedullary nail), NPO/IVF, medicine consult/clearance pending, DVT prophylaxis pre-op, anesthesia preference “favor spinal” in consult.
  - PRESENT in record (operative note): anesthesia type “general”, post-op WBAT, DVT prophylaxis plan (ASA 81 BID POD1 + SCDs + mobilization), antibiotics x24h, discharge criteria.
  - MISSING/UNCLEAR: a dedicated rehab plan (PT/OT goals are referenced in discharge criteria, but no detailed rehab pathway in consult).

6) Informed consent structure
- AI-added improvement: Added structured consent language (“capacity”, “questions answered”, etc.).
- Record support check: PRESENT IN SUBSTANCE (raw consult note documents discussion of options/risks/benefits/alternatives and “booked/consented”).
- CDI comment: If using structured consent text, ensure it matches what occurred and aligns with institutional consent documentation standards.

================================================================================
Section B — Physician-input suggestions (explicit “NEEDS/PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED” items)
Sources:
- 1.txt placeholders: [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: …]
- JSON: enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required

Below is a consolidated list, with “is it available in the record?” testing:

1) Fall details + pain assessment (date/time/mechanism/location; pain 0–10, quality, modifiers)

- Tagged as physician input required by AI (1.txt).
- Record support check: MISSING IN THIS DOCUMENT SET (consult note references ordering osteoporosis labs but does not include results).

7) Pre-op risk assessment / ASA class; optimization needs
- Tagged as physician input required by AI (1.txt) and “medical clearance/optimization” in JSON (medium priority).

  - PRESENT: detailed DVT prophylaxis + discharge criteria + “pain controlled with oral analgesia” in operative note.
  - PARTIAL: discharge planning specifics (destination, home vs rehab) not documented in these excerpts.

10) Medical necessity “specific indications for surgery” and “why conservative management not appropriate”
- Tagged as physician input required by AI (1.txt).
- Record support check: PRESENT IN SUBSTANCE
  - Raw consult note contains rationale about high morbidity/mortality if untreated and discusses nonoperative vs operative with risks and decision for ORIF.
  - Operative note further documents nonoperative risks (bedsores/DVT/pneumonia/etc.) and benefits of surgery.

================================================================================
Section C — AI recommendations (from JSON “recommendations” array)
Source: multi_chart_...json → enhanced_by_ai.recommendations

1) Document specific fracture classification (AO/OTA) to support selection of cephalomedullary nail (Priority: HIGH)
- Record support check: MISSING (no AO/OTA classification documented; imaging description minimal).

2) Clearly document pre-injury functional status (Priority: HIGH)
- Record support check: PRESENT (baseline ambulates without assistive device).
- CDI note: Consider adding ADLs/IADLs and living situation for stronger baseline documentation.

3) Include specific post-op weight-bearing instructions and rehab plan in surgical planning section (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Record support check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: operative note states WBAT and discharge criteria tied to PT goals.
  - MISSING: explicit rehab plan details (PT/OT frequency, anticipated disposition, milestones) in consult note.

4) Document medical risk assessment and optimization strategies for elderly patient with comorbidities (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Record support check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: “medicine consult for pre operative risk stratification”; operative note says medicine cleared.
  - MISSING: formal risk stratification detail (ASA class, cardiac risk, anticoag/bleeding risk plan) in these notes.

================================================================================
Section D — CDI expert opinion: additional documentation opportunities (beyond what the AI listed)
These are common CDI opportunities for geriatric hip fracture/ORIF cases, based on what is visible in this record set:

1) Laterality + displacement consistency across notes
- Opportunity: Ensure “Left intertrochanteric femur fracture” is consistently characterized (e.g., displaced vs nondisplaced) across consult and operative documentation.
- Evidence: operative note explicitly states “displaced”; consult imaging line does not.

2) Fragility fracture / osteoporosis clarification
- Opportunity: Given age and history of osteopenia, consider clarifying whether this represents a fragility fracture due to underlying osteoporosis.
- Evidence: osteopenia is listed; osteoporosis labs are ordered; no explicit “osteoporosis” diagnosis or “pathologic fracture” language is documented here.

3) Comorbidity specificity for risk adjustment (only if clinically supported)
- Opportunity: confirm the status/impact of key comorbidities on care (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP—patient “has not worn in years”; thoracic aortic aneurysm 4.2cm; obesity; diabetes vs prediabetes).
- CDI caution: do not upcode—only document what is evaluated/treated/impacts care.

4) Functional baseline and discharge disposition
- Opportunity: add home environment and baseline ADLs/IADLs and anticipated discharge destination (home vs SNF/acute rehab) to support medical necessity/utilization decisions.

================================================================================
Section E — Suggested CDI query list (actionable, record-grounded)
If your CDI workflow uses queries, these are high-yield and compliant with what is currently missing/partial:

1) Fracture classification
- Query: Please document fracture classification (e.g., AO/OTA) and key features (displacement/comminution/stability) for the left intertrochanteric femur fracture.

2) Fall circumstances and pain assessment
- Query: Please document fall circumstances (date/time/location/mechanism) and pain assessment (0–10 severity, quality, aggravating/alleviating factors).

3) Baseline function and living situation
- Query: Please document baseline ADLs/IADLs, living arrangement, and available support system pre-injury.

4) Osteoporosis / fragility fracture clarification (if clinically appropriate)
- Query: Given age/osteopenia and low-energy fall, please clarify whether the fracture is considered a fragility fracture due to osteoporosis.

5) Pre-op risk assessment details
- Query: Please document pre-op risk assessment details (e.g., ASA class, key optimization actions) if performed.

================================================================================
Bottom line
- AI-added “improvements” mainly enhance structure/readability and add template prompts.
- Several “physician input required” flags are FALSE gaps because the raw consult note already contains vitals/exam/imaging/plan items.
- True, record-supported improvement targets are: fracture classification detail, fall/pain details, baseline living/support, and more explicit risk stratification/optimization documentation.
