X rays in the emergency room demonstrated evidence of a displaced \nfemoral fracture. Given the nature of the injury, a discussion regarding the risks associated with and the alternatives to \nsurgery were discussed. This discussion included the potential complications of deep venous thrombosis, infection, nerve \nor blood vessel injury, ligament injury, dislocation, leg length discrepancy, fracture, mal- or non-union, and incomplete \nresolution of pain, the patient wished to proceed with open reduction and intramedullary nailing of the femur.\n\n2032891261 10/10/2025 11:50:41 AM PAGE 3/003 Fax 5erver \nHegedus, Marianne (MRN MR598089) Page 2 of 2 \nOperative Note by Choo, Kevin, MD at 10/9/2025 5:19 PM (continued)   \nProcedure: \nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful induction of spinal anesthesia, a closed \nreduction was performed. Flouroscopy was used to confirm that the reduction was within acceptable parameters. The \nlower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with the patient in the supine position on the \nfracture table. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered within 30 minutes prior to the procedure as well as 1 gram of \ntranexamic acid. A time out was performed by all members of the surgical team confirming patient identity and surgical \nsite laterality. \nA lateral incision was made proximal to, and in-line with, the femur. The entry guidewire was then advanced onto the \nappropriate start site on the greater trochanter. This was confirmed with intraoperative flouroscopy on both the AP and \nlateral views. The guidewire was then advanced with power into the intramedullary canal. Again flouroscopy was used to \nconfirm that the entry guidewire was in the appropriate position. The entry reamer was then used through the soft tissue \nprotector canula. Flouroscopy was used to confirm appropriate position of the entry reamer within the intramedullary canal \nand that it had been advanced to a sufficient depth. The reamer and entry guidewire were then removed. \nThe nail was then carefully advanced over the guidewire. During advancement of the nail, all reduction maneuvers were \nemployed to maintain the reduction during insertion of the nail. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the nail had \nbeen advanced to the appropriate depth. The long guidewire was then removed. An incision was made over the lateral \naspect of the thigh and the cannula for the lag screw was advanced until it made contact with the lateral cortical bone. \nUsing flouroscopic guidance, the guidewire for the lag screw was then inserted and confirmed to be in appropriate position \nwith the guidwire center-center on AP and lateral views of the femoral head. The depth of the guidewire was then \nmeasured and the 95 mm lag screw selected. The guidewire was then overdrilled and tapped for the screw of the \nappropriate depth. The lag screw was then inserted to the appropriate depth which again confirmed using flouroscopy. \nWe then turned our attention to insertion of the distal interlocking screw. A small incision was made over the lateral thigh \nin line with the cannula for the distal interlocking screw. The cannula was then advanced through the incision and down to \nbone. The drill was then carefully advanced and the depth of the interlocking screw measured off of the drill. The screw of \nappropriate length was then inserted. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the screws were in appropriate position. \nThe wounds were then copiously irrigated. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl suture. The deep subcutaneous \nlayers were closed with interrupted 0 vicryl and the dermal layer with 3-0 vicryl. The skin was then closed with staples. \nSterile dressings were then applied and the patient was awaken from anesthesia. The patient was transferred to the \nrecovery room in stable condition. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. \nPostop Plan \nThe patient will be WBAT (protected weight bearing with a walker). DVT prophylaxis will be started with aspirin starting \nPOD1 additional DVT prophylaxis will include SCDs, compression stockings, progressive mobilization. They will receive \n24 hours of postoperative antibiotics. The patient will be discharged from the hospital when they are medically stable, \nhave met all PT goals, and their pain is well controlled with oral analgesia. \nKevin Choo, MD\n=== END CHART: tmpd59q3a_y.pdf ===\n",
