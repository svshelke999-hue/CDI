CDI Expert Review Report (AI “Improved Chart” vs Medical Record Evidence)
Folder: test_mult_for_report/3
Prepared: 2026-02-02

Scope / Files Reviewed
- 1) 3..txt (AI “improved” orthopedic admission H&P with AI-added headers and physician-input placeholders)
- 2) multi_chart_1769771908_20260130_164828_numbered_chart.txt (raw medical record text: admission note + operative note content)
- 3) multi_chart_1769771908_20260130_164828.json (raw AI output with “improvements”, “user_input_required”, “recommendations”)

Case synopsis (record-based)
- 81-year-old female with mechanical fall while at dinner (10/08/2025) → right hip pain and inability to bear weight.
- Imaging: “Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the right hip with intact mid to distal femur.”
- Plan/Procedure: right hip ORIF; operative note indicates open reduction + intramedullary nailing; diagnosis “displaced”.
- PMH: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, vasculitis.

Method (how the “test” was done)
- Extracted AI-added items and prompts from:
  - 3..txt tags: [AI ADDED], [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED]
  - JSON: enhanced_by_ai.improvements, enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required, enhanced_by_ai.recommendations
- Cross-checked each prompt against the raw record to label:
  - PRESENT (already documented),
  - PARTIAL (some elements present but not complete),
  - MISSING (not found / needs clarification).

Key CDI finding (high-signal)
- The AI “improved chart” flags several sections as missing (imaging/labs/right hip detailed exam) that are already present in the raw admission note.
- Remaining true gaps are mainly: pain score documentation, baseline functional status details (assistive device/ADLs), alcohol quantity/frequency, and formal fracture classification (AO/OTA) + ASA/risk stratification.

================================================================================
Section A — “AI Added” improvements (what the AI changed/added)
Source: JSON → enhanced_by_ai.improvements (also visible in 3..txt)

1) Structure / section headers / clinical flow
- AI-added: Added clear section headers and organized content.
- Evidence check: NOT APPLICABLE (formatting).

2) Enhanced HPI (template placeholders)
- AI-added: placeholders for pain severity (0–10), functional limitations, and “planned ORIF”.
- Evidence check:
  - Planned ORIF: PRESENT (raw plan and operative note support).
  - Pain score: MISSING (no 0–10 rating seen).
  - Functional limitations: PRESENT for current (“unable to bear weight”); baseline details are PARTIAL (see Section B).

3) Added baseline living situation / functional status sections (template prompts)
- AI-added: dedicated sections for living arrangement and baseline function.
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - Housing stability (“steady place to live”) is present.
  - Detailed home setup (stairs/support) is missing.
  - Baseline function is implied (“independently mobilizing”) but not fully described.

4) “More comprehensive physical exam” placeholders
- AI-added: prompts for more detail in heart/lungs/abdomen and right hip NV status.
- Evidence check: MIXED
  - Right hip detailed exam/NV status: PRESENT in raw record (tenderness, motor groups, pulses, distal NVI, pain with passive motion).
  - Heart/lungs/abdomen: PARTIAL (documented as “regular rate”, “non labored”, “soft non-distended” without full descriptors).

5) Structured assessment/plan and medical necessity paragraph
- AI-added: explicit problem list and medical necessity statement for ORIF vs conservative care.
- Evidence check: PRESENT IN SUBSTANCE
  - Raw admission note documents rationale: given independent mobility, non-operative management inappropriate; risks/benefits discussed; patient wants surgery.
  - Operative note supports surgical indication and inability to bear weight.

================================================================================

2) Baseline functional status (ambulatory status, assistive device, ADLs independence)
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: narrative indicates she is “independently mobilizing” (baseline independence implied).
  - MISSING: explicit assistive device use, ADLs/IADLs, baseline distance tolerance, falls history.

3) Diabetes details (type, duration, control, HbA1c)
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: diabetes mellitus exists; inpatient insulin regimen is documented.
  - MISSING: diabetes type confirmation, duration, HbA1c, control status.

4) Home environment/living arrangement (stairs/support)
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: MISSING (only “steady place to live”; no stairs/support details).

5) Detailed fracture description from imaging (displacement/comminution pattern/stability)
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: imaging states “comminuted intertrochanteric fracture”; operative note states “displaced”.
  - MISSING: formal fracture classification (AO/OTA), stability, detailed pattern descriptors.

6) Relevant lab results (CBC/CMP/coags)
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PRESENT (WBC, Hgb/Hct, Na/Cl, Cr/BUN, INR documented).

7) Specific surgical approach + implant considerations

- Evidence check: PRESENT (operative note documents intramedullary nail construct; admission plan states ORIF).

8) ASA class / cardiac risk / anesthesia considerations
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: EKG findings (NSR + LBBB) and coags/labs; anesthesia type in operative note = spinal.
  - MISSING: explicit ASA class and formal risk stratification documentation.

2) Pre-injury function + limitations (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (baseline independence implied; details missing).

3) Detailed fracture characteristics supporting surgery (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (comminution and displacement present; formal classification/details missing).

4) Explicitly document why conservative management is not appropriate (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PRESENT (raw admission note explicitly states non-operative management inappropriate; risk/benefit discussion).

5) Perioperative management plans for DM/HTN (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (meds listed; no explicit targets/management plan narrative).

6) Discharge planning/rehab needs + home environment (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - Operative note includes WBAT (protected with walker) and discharge after PT goals/pain controlled.
  - Home environment/support needs not documented here.

================================================================================
Section D — CDI expert opinion: additional documentation opportunities

1) Fragility fracture / osteoporosis context (if clinically appropriate)
- Opportunity: for an 81-year-old with low-energy fall, consider clarifying whether this is a fragility fracture due to osteoporosis/osteopenia (only if evaluated/treated).

2) Electrolyte abnormality impact (hyponatremia)
- Opportunity: Na 128 is documented; if clinically significant and treated/monitored, clarify diagnosis/management (e.g., acute vs chronic hyponatremia) per facility CDI policy.

3) Cognitive status baseline clarification
- Observation: patient on donepezil; raw note states “mental status at baseline.”
- Opportunity: if diagnosis exists (dementia/MCI), document baseline and peri-op risk implications (delirium precautions), rather than inferring solely from medication list.

================================================================================
Section E — Suggested compliant CDI query list (record-grounded)

1) Fracture classification
- Query: Please document formal fracture classification (e.g., AO/OTA) and key characteristics (stability/pattern) of the right intertrochanteric fracture.

2) Baseline function
- Query: Please document pre-injury ambulatory status (assistive devices), ADLs/IADLs independence, and current functional limitations.

3) Pain severity
- Query: Please document pain severity score (0–10) at rest and with movement, if assessed.

4) Diabetes specificity
- Query: Please clarify diabetes type and control status (most recent HbA1c if available).

5) Alcohol use details
- Query: Please document alcohol use frequency/quantity.

6) ASA / risk stratification
- Query: Please document ASA class and key perioperative risk assessment considerations (cardiac/anesthesia).

Bottom line
- The AI “improved chart” correctly emphasizes payer-friendly elements (pain score, baseline function, fracture detail, discharge planning).
- Several “missing” prompts are false gaps because the raw record already includes imaging, labs, and a detailed right hip neurovascular exam.
- Highest-yield true documentation gaps: pain score, detailed baseline function/home support, alcohol quantity, AO/OTA fracture classification, and explicit ASA/risk stratification.
