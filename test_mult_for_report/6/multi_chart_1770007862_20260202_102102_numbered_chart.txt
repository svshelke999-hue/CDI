L391: 
L392: Impression and plan:
L393: 
L394: Renke B Thye is a 87 y.o. male sustained a Left displaced femoral neck fracture. Femur fractures in the elderly are of
L395: the highest severity due to the morbidity without treatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of
L396: ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications causing death. Therefore | had a long discussion with the
L397: patient and their family about the treatment options, including nonoperative and operative intervention. We
L398: discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to surgery as well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after.
L399: After going over these options, we decided to pursue a left total hip replacement due to his activity level and pre-fall
L400: high level unassisted ambulation.
L401: 
L402: We discussed the risks of surgery including infection, wound complications, bleeding, need for a transfusion, possible
L403: damage to surronding neurovascular structures, potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain
L404: and worsening weakness, stiffness, instability/dislocation, limb length discrepancy, fracture, infection requiring the
L405: resection or revision arthroplasty, component loosening and the need for revision surgery in the future. We also
L406: discussed the risks of thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart attack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary
L407: edema, fat/cement embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia and nerve blocks.
L408: 
L409: Would favor spinal anesthesia and early care as delay in care results in perioperative morbidity and mortality with
L410: geriatric femur fractures.

L646: Findings: Displaced subcapital left femoral neck fracture
L647: 
L648: Indication:
L649: 
L650: The patient is a 87 y.o. male who presented to our emergency room after a fall and was found to have a left hip
L651: displaced femoral neck fracture. Femur fractures in the elderly are of the highest severity due to the morbidity without
L652: treatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications
L653: causing death. Therefore | had a long discussion with the patient and their family about the treatment options,
L654: including nonoperative and operative intervention. We discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to surgery as
L655: well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. We discussed the risks of surgery including infection, wound
L656: complications, bleeding, need for a transfusion, possible damage to surronding neurovascular structures, potential for
L657: continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and worsening weakness, stiffness, instability/dislocation, limb
L658: length discrepancy, fracture, infection requiring the resection or revision arthroplasty, component loosening and the
L659: need for revision surgery in the future. We also discussed the risks of thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart
L660: attack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary edema, fat embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia.
L661: The potential benefits of surgery are pain relief or improvement, improved mobility, and allowance of immediate
L662: weight bearing post-operatively. We also discussed some of the risks specific to the anterior approach including
L663: numbness over the lateral thigh, wound complications, and femoral component loosening or fracture of the femur.
L664: These risks were discussed in the context of other approaches, specifically the posterior approach and its associated
L665: risks. The patient expressed an understanding of these risks and the patient wished to proceed with a total hip
L666: replacement. We did discuss hemiarthroplasty, however given the patients high functional demand he and his wife
L667: elected to proceed with a total hip replacement.
L668: 
L669: We also discussed the overall poor prognosis for patients who have suffered a femur fracture, with high morbidity and
L670: mortality rates following this particular pattern of injury. The patient and family expressed understanding and elected
L671: to proceed with a total hip replacement.
L672: 
L673: The patient was seen by the Medicine service and was determined to be optimized from a medical standpoint for this
L674: surgery. The medicine team cleared the patient for surgery as well.
L675: 
L676: Description of procedure:
L677: The patient was seen in the preoperative holding area and the appropriate side lower extremity was marked. Again a
L678: discussion of the procedure was held with the patient and the patient wished to proceed.
L679: 
L680: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and a preliminary anesthesia time out was then performed. Spinal
L681: anesthesia was then performed by the anesthesia team, however was unsuccessful and he was converted to
L682: general. The patient was then placed supine on the operating room table. Preoperative antibiotics were administered
L683: within thirty minutes of incision time as well as 1 gram of tranexamic acid. The patient was placed onto a sacral bump
L684: on the operating room table. At this point, the patient's surgical area was prepped and draped in the standard, sterile
L685: fashion. A surgical timeout was then performed to confirm the correct side, procedure, and name.
L686: 
L687: A longitudinal incision was made starting lateral and distal to the anterior superior iliac spine. The incision was
L688: carried down through the subcutaneous tissues down to the level of the tensor fascia lata. The tensor fascia lata was
L689: then divided sharply with care not to violate the muscle below. Blunt dissection of the fascia was done to identify the
L690: interval between the tensor fascia lata and the sartorius. Once this was done and deeper retractors had been placed,
L691: the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery was clearly visualized and this was cauterized. Next, the
L692: fat within this interval was dissected to better visualize the anterior hip capsule and the lateral border of the
L693: iliocapsularis. At this point, a Cobb was used to elevate the iliocapsularis and rectus off the anterior capsule and a
L694: retractor was placed underneath these muscles. At this point, a capsulectomy was performed along the axis of the
L695: femoral neck and the intertrochanteric ridge. A large hemarthrosis from the fracture was encountered. The retractors
L696: were now placed intracapsular and the head-neck junction was exposed. A release of the pubofemoral ligament was
L697: then performed until the lesser trochanter could be palpated. Using the pre-operative templating, the appropriate
L698: clean up neck cut was made and the femoral head and remaining neck was extracted.
L699: 
L700: The acetabulum was now visualized with the placement of retractors. At this point, the labrum and the contents of the

L704: 
L705: cotyloid fossa were removed. The acetabulum was then reamed sequentially, based on preoperative templating.
L706: Reaming was performed carefully. Next, the final size 56mm acetabular component was impacted into the
L707: appropriate position. The periphery of the acetabular component was inspected and any osteophytes were removed.
L708: Once this was accomplished, the final 40mm neutral polyethylene liner was impacted into place. Care was taken to
L709: ensure that the liner was fully seated and had engaged the locking mechanism.
L710: 
L711: Next, the acetabular retractors were removed and attention was turned to the femur. The leg was positioned in an
L712: adducted and extended position. Retractors were then placed around the proximal femur to expose the cut neck
L713: surface. Tight capsular tissue over the superior/anterior aspect of the femoral neck was released using cautery only
L714: to allow for sufficient exposure. A curved double footed retractor was placed over the greater trochanter laterally and
L715: a femoral retractor placed at the infero medial neck. Sequential releases were performed in order to allow for
L716: accepted elevation of the femur, this was done in conjunction with gentle elevation with a bone hook.
L717: 
L718: The canal finder was then used to establish the IM canal. A box cutter was used to remove posterolateral bone of the
L719: cut neck. Arasp and curette were used to remove lateral femoral neck bone remaining. An entry broach was
L720: utilized, followed by sequential broaching up to the final size. With the broach left in place and after calcar planning,
L721: the neck and trials were placed. The hip was reduced and found to be stable. Leg length, offset and implant size and
L722: position were assessed clinically. Afterwards, the hip was dislocated. The trial components were removed.
L723: 
L724: The femoral canal was irrigated and a cement restrictor was placed down the canal. The canal was again rinsed and
L725: dried. Cement was then placed in the canal and pressurized, and the final size 5 standard stem was placed in the
L726: canal. After the cement hardened the actual 40mm +4 head was now impacted into place after cleaning and drying.
L727: The hip was reduced with traction and internal rotation after confirming that the acetabular component was free of
L728: any debris and had been irrigated.
L729: 
L730: The wound was then copiously irrigated and washed with a dilute betadine solution then with normal saline. Copious
L731: irrigation was used throughout the closure. 1 gram of Vancomycin powder was placed in the deep wound. The fascia
L732: overlying the TFL was now closed using running barbed suture, with care to not entrap any of the lateral femoral
L733: cutaneous nerve branches. The remainder of the wound was closed in layers using #1 Vicryl, 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Monocry|
L734: with prineo/Dermabond for skin. Standard mepilex dressing was applied in the standard fashion and the patient was
L735: transferred to the Recovery Room in stable condition. All sponge, needle counts were correct x 2.
L736: 
L737: SN redapt/cemented polarstem components were used in this procedure.
