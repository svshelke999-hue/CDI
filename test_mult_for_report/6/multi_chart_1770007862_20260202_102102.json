Femur fractures in the elderly are of the highest severity due to the morbidity without\ntreatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications\ncausing death. Therefore | had a long discussion with the patient and their family about the treatment options,\nincluding nonoperative and operative intervention. We discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to surgery as\nwell as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. We discussed the risks of surgery including infection, wound\ncomplications, bleeding, need for a transfusion, possible damage to surronding neurovascular structures, potential for\ncontinued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and worsening weakness, stiffness, instability/dislocation, limb\nlength discrepancy, fracture, infection requiring the resection or revision arthroplasty, component loosening and the\nneed for revision surgery in the future. We also discussed the risks of thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart\nattack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary edema, fat embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia.\nThe potential benefits of surgery are pain relief or improvement, improved mobility, and allowance of immediate\nweight bearing post-operatively. We also discussed some of the risks specific to the anterior approach including\nnumbness over the lateral thigh, wound complications, and femoral component loosening or fracture of the femur.\nThese risks were discussed in the context of other approaches, specifically the posterior approach and its associated\nrisks. The patient expressed an understanding of these risks and the patient wished to proceed with a total hip\nreplacement. We did discuss hemiarthroplasty, however given the patients high functional demand he and his wife\nelected to proceed with a total hip replacement.\n\nWe also discussed the overall poor prognosis for patients who have suffered a femur fracture, with high morbidity and\nmortality rates following this particular pattern of injury. The patient and family expressed understanding and elected\nto proceed with a total hip replacement.\n\nThe patient was seen by the Medicine service and was determined to be optimized from a medical standpoint for this\nsurgery. The medicine team cleared the patient for surgery as well.\n\nDescription of procedure:\nThe patient was seen in the preoperative holding area and the appropriate side lower extremity was marked. Again a\ndiscussion of the procedure was held with the patient and the patient wished to proceed.\n\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room and a preliminary anesthesia time out was then performed. Spinal\nanesthesia was then performed by the anesthesia team, however was unsuccessful and he was converted to\ngeneral. The patient was then placed supine on the operating room table. Preoperative antibiotics were administered\nwithin thirty minutes of incision time as well as 1 gram of tranexamic acid. The patient was placed onto a sacral bump\non the operating room table. At this point, the patient's surgical area was prepped and draped in the standard, sterile\nfashion. A surgical timeout was then performed to confirm the correct side, procedure, and name.\n\nA longitudinal incision was made starting lateral and distal to the anterior superior iliac spine. The incision was\ncarried down through the subcutaneous tissues down to the level of the tensor fascia lata. The tensor fascia lata was\nthen divided sharply with care not to violate the muscle below. Blunt dissection of the fascia was done to identify the\ninterval between the tensor fascia lata and the sartorius. Once this was done and deeper retractors had been placed,\nthe ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery was clearly visualized and this was cauterized. Next, the\nfat within this interval was dissected to better visualize the anterior hip capsule and the lateral border of the\niliocapsularis. At this point, a Cobb was used to elevate the iliocapsularis and rectus off the anterior capsule and a\nretractor was placed underneath these muscles. At this point, a capsulectomy was performed along the axis of the\nfemoral neck and the intertrochanteric ridge. A large hemarthrosis from the fracture was encountered. The retractors\nwere now placed intracapsular and the head-neck junction was exposed. A release of the pubofemoral ligament was\nthen performed until the lesser trochanter could be palpated. Using the pre-operative templating, the appropriate\nclean up neck cut was made and the femoral head and remaining neck was extracted.\n\nThe acetabulum was now visualized with the placement of retractors. At this point, the labrum and the contents of the\nThye, Renke B (MRN MR364652) Printed by Stagno, Cesarina [767] at 12/30/2025 4:21 PM 2/4\n\n12/30/25, 4:22 PM Thye, Renke B (MR # MR364652) DOB: 07/30/1938\n\ncotyloid fossa were removed. The acetabulum was then reamed sequentially, based on preoperative templating.\nReaming was performed carefully. Next, the final size 56mm acetabular component was impacted into the\nappropriate position. The periphery of the acetabular component was inspected and any osteophytes were removed.\nOnce this was accomplished, the final 40mm neutral polyethylene liner was impacted into place. Care was taken to\nensure that the liner was fully seated and had engaged the locking mechanism.\n\nNext, the acetabular retractors were removed and attention was turned to the femur. The leg was positioned in an\nadducted and extended position. Retractors were then placed around the proximal femur to expose the cut neck\nsurface. Tight capsular tissue over the superior/anterior aspect of the femoral neck was released using cautery only\nto allow for sufficient exposure. A curved double footed retractor was placed over the greater trochanter laterally and\na femoral retractor placed at the infero medial neck. Sequential releases were performed in order to allow for\naccepted elevation of the femur, this was done in conjunction with gentle elevation with a bone hook.\n\nThe canal finder was then used to establish the IM canal. A box cutter was used to remove posterolateral bone of the\ncut neck. Arasp and curette were used to remove lateral femoral neck bone remaining. An entry broach was\nutilized, followed by sequential broaching up to the final size. With the broach left in place and after calcar planning,\nthe neck and trials were placed. The hip was reduced and found to be stable. Leg length, offset and implant size and\nposition were assessed clinically. Afterwards, the hip was dislocated. The trial components were removed.\n\nThe femoral canal was irrigated and a cement restrictor was placed down the canal. The canal was again rinsed and\ndried. Cement was then placed in the canal and pressurized, and the final size 5 standard stem was placed in the\ncanal. After the cement hardened the actual 40mm +4 head was now impacted into place after cleaning and drying.\nThe hip was reduced with traction and internal rotation after confirming that the acetabular component was free of\nany debris and had been irrigated.\n\nThe wound was then copiously irrigated and washed with a dilute betadine solution then with normal saline. Copious\nirrigation was used throughout the closure. 1 gram of Vancomycin powder was placed in the deep wound. The fascia\noverlying the TFL was now closed using running barbed suture, with care to not entrap any of the lateral femoral\ncutaneous nerve branches. The remainder of the wound was closed in layers using #1 Vicryl, 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Monocry|\nwith prineo/Dermabond for skin. Standard mepilex dressing was applied in the standard fashion and the patient was\ntransferred to the Recovery Room in stable condition. All sponge, needle counts were correct x 2.\n\nSN redapt/cemented polarstem components were used in this procedure.\n\nPostoperative Plan:\n\nWBAT: wbat\n\nPT/OT: OOB and ambulation\n\nPain control: Oxycodone 5mg as needed for moderate pain; Tylenol for mild pain\nDVT ppx: asa 81 bid\n\nPeriop ancef, followed by 7 days of cefadroxil due to high risk fracture\nColace 100mg BID while taking oxycodone\n\nKeep dressing clean and dry\n\nZofran PRN while taking oxycodone\n\nResume Home Medications\n\nMedical comanagement by hospitalist service, appreciate recommendations\nDispo: pending PT/OT eval\n\nMichael B Held, MD\n\nDate: 12/29/2025 Time: 3:18 PM\n\nElectronically signed by Held, Michael Brian, MD at 12/29/2025 3:23 PM\n\nED to Hosp-Admission (Current) on 12/28/2025 Note shared with patient\n\nRouting History\n\nPriority Sent On From To Message Type\nt 12/28/2025 10:08 Edi, Rad Results In Aversano, Francis, MD Results\n\nAM\nt 12/28/2025 10:08 — Edi, Rad Results In Casarella, Ryan Patrick, MD Results\n\nAM\n\nThye, Renke B (MRN MR364652) Printed by Stagno, Cesarina [767] at 12/30/2025 4:21 PM 3/4\n\n12/30/25, 4:22 PM\n\nPriority\nt\n\n=—- =—=_  —_  —_ —_ =_—_\n\nSent On\n12/28/2025 10:00\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 10:00\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 9:15\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 9:15\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 9:15\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 9:15\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 9:13\nAM\n\n12/28/2025 9:13\nAM\n\nThye, Renke B (MR # MR364652) DOB: 07/30/1938\n\nFrom\n\nLab, Background User\n\nLab, Background User\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nTo\nAversano, Francis, MD\n\nCasarella, Ryan Patrick, MD\nAversano, Francis, MD\nCasarella, Ryan Patrick, MD\nAversano, Francis, MD\nCasarella, Ryan Patrick, MD\nAversano, Francis, MD\n\nCasarella, Ryan Patrick, MD\n\nThye, Renke B (MRN MR364652) Printed by Stagno, Cesarina [767] at 12/30/2025 4:21 PM\n\nMessage Type\nResults\n\nResults\nResults\nResults\nResults\nResults\nResults\n\nResults\n\n4/4\n=== END CHART: tmpysqmhuab.pdf ===\n",

[AI ADDED: Clinical significance statement] Femur fractures in the elderly are of the highest severity due to the morbidity without treatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications causing death.\n\n[AI ADDED: Section header]\nDISCUSSION:\nI had a long discussion with the patient and their family about the treatment options, including nonoperative and operative intervention. We discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to surgery as well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. After going over these options, we decided to pursue a left total hip replacement due to his activity level and pre-fall high level unassisted ambulation.\n\nWe discussed the risks of surgery including:\n[AI ADDED: Organized risk discussion]\n- Infection, wound complications\n- Bleeding, need for a transfusion\n- Possible damage to surrounding neurovascular structures\n- Potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and worsening weakness\n- Stiffness, instability/dislocation\n- Limb length discrepancy\n- Fracture\n- Infection requiring the resection or revision arthroplasty\n- Component loosening and the need for revision surgery in the future\n- Thromboembolic complications\n- Stroke, heart attack, cardiac event, heart failure\n- Pulmonary edema, fat/cement embolus\n- Aspiration\n- Death\n- Risks of anesthesia and nerve blocks\n\n[AI ADDED: Medical necessity documentation]\nMEDICAL NECESSITY DOCUMENTATION:\nSurgical intervention with total hip arthroplasty is medically necessary for this patient due to:\n1. Displaced femoral neck fracture in an elderly patient\n2. Patient's high pre-injury functional status (independent ambulation, 5000 steps daily)\n3. Significant risk of morbidity and mortality with non-operative management\n4.
