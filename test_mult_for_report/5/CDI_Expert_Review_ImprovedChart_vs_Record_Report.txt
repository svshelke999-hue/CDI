CDI Expert Review Report (AI “Improved Chart” vs Medical Record Evidence)
Folder: test_mult_for_report/5
Prepared: 2026-02-02

Scope / Files Reviewed
- 1) 5.txt (AI “improved” orthopedic consultation note with AI-added sections + physician-input placeholders)
- 2) multi_chart_1769772659_20260130_170059_numbered_chart.txt (raw medical record text: consult note + operative note)
- 3) multi_chart_1769772659_20260130_170059.json (raw AI output with “improvements”, “user_input_required”, “recommendations”)

Case synopsis (record-based)
- 88-year-old male with mechanical fall → left hip pain and inability to ambulate.
- Imaging: XR AP pelvis + femur demonstrates “left displaced femoral neck hip fracture with preexisting degenerative joint disease.”
- Decision documented: proceed with left total hip replacement (THA) given preexisting OA/DJD.
- Operative note: left total hip replacement for intracapsular displaced femoral neck fracture + incisional negative pressure wound therapy; post-op WBAT and DVT prophylaxis with Eliquis.

Method (how the “test” was done)
- Extracted AI-added items and “needs physician input” prompts from:
  - 5.txt tags: [AI ADDED], [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED]
  - JSON: enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required and enhanced_by_ai.recommendations
- Cross-checked each suggestion against the raw consult + operative note to label:
  - PRESENT (already documented),
  - PARTIAL (some elements present but incomplete),
  - MISSING (not found / needs clarification).

Key CDI finding (high-signal)
- The improved chart lists several “missing” items that are already present in the record, particularly in the operative note:
  - Post-op WB status, DVT prophylaxis medication + duration, PT/OT plan, and antibiotic plan.
- The highest-yield true gaps are: standardized pain score/character, quantified social history (alcohol quantity; smoking pack-years), and formal fracture classification (Garden) if used/required.

================================================================================
Section A — “AI Added” improvements (what the AI changed/added)
Source: JSON enhanced_by_ai.improvements (partial) + visible content in 5.txt

1) Structure / headers / problem-oriented format
- AI-added: organized note into labeled sections (HPI, PMH, vitals, exam, plan, risk assessment, post-op plan).
- Evidence check: NOT APPLICABLE (formatting).

2) Medical necessity narrative emphasis
- AI-added: explicit medical necessity framing for surgery and prompts for payer-required specifics.
- Evidence check: PRESENT IN SUBSTANCE (raw consult note contains strong narrative about morbidity/mortality risk without treatment and rationale for operative vs non-operative management).

================================================================================
Section B — Physician-input suggestions (AI prompts) + evidence check
Sources:
- 5.txt prompts
- JSON enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required (pain, baseline function, neurovascular detail grading, imaging details, post-op plan, DVT regimen)

1) Pain assessment details (0–10, character, aggravating/alleviating factors, functional limitation)
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: functional limitation (inability to ambulate); pain worse with ROM; mechanism described.
  - MISSING: numeric pain score (0–10), pain character, and relieving factors.

2) Baseline functional status / living situation / ADLs / assistive devices
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM (JSON) and social history prompt in 5.txt
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: baseline ambulates without assistive device.
  - MISSING: living situation/home setup/support system and ADL/IADL baseline.

3) Detailed neurovascular exam with motor strength grading 0–5
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: motor function documented (ankle DF/PF/EHL intact) and sensation distribution + pulses documented.
  - MISSING: graded strength (0–5) and more granular sensory description.

4) Imaging specifics to support procedure selection (Garden classification; displacement degree; OA/DJD description)
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: “left displaced femoral neck hip fracture with preexisting degenerative joint disease.”
  - MISSING: formal Garden classification and displacement descriptors (e.g., impacted vs fully displaced) beyond “displaced”.

5) Post-op weight-bearing and rehab protocol
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PRESENT (operative note: WBAT; PT/OT OOB and ambulation).

6) DVT prophylaxis regimen (med, duration, monitoring)
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PRESENT (operative note: Eliquis 2.5 BID x 28 days).

================================================================================
Section C — AI recommendations (JSON recommendations array) + evidence check

1) Document pain severity (0–10) and functional limitations (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (functional limitation present; pain score missing).

2) Document Garden classification + detailed OA description to support THA vs hemi decision (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - OA/DJD is explicitly documented.
  - Garden classification is not documented in provided notes.

3) Explicit medical necessity section: why THA vs hemi for this specific patient (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PRESENT IN SUBSTANCE
  - Consult explicitly states decision for THA “given his preexisting osteoarthritis of the left hip.”
  - If payer requires more: add brief statement that THA addresses both fracture and symptomatic OA and supports functional expectations (only if accurate).

4) Document comprehensive post-op plan (WB, DVT, rehab) (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PRESENT (operative note documents WBAT, PT/OT, DVT, pain control, antibiotics, dispo pending PT/OT).

================================================================================
Section D — CDI expert opinion: additional opportunities (case-specific)

1) PMH/PSH completeness inconsistency
- Observation: consult’s PMHx/PSHx sections state “No past medical/surgical history on file” while HPI lists multiple comorbidities (HTN/HLD/CAD s/p MI+stents/CKD3/anemia/IBS/aortic stenosis).
- CDI opportunity: ensure PMH is populated consistently (even if “per patient” or “per chart”) to avoid internal contradictions.

2) Procedure selection documentation (THA for fracture)
- Strength: imaging documents preexisting DJD and consult states THA chosen for that reason.
- Opportunity: add a short structured justification (fracture type + OA + baseline function) if payer tends to scrutinize THA vs hemi in acute fracture cases.

3) AKI on CKD / dialysis risk
- Strength: consult and op note mention AKI on CKD and dialysis risk; “medicine cleared/optimized” is documented.
- Opportunity: ensure medical optimization details are available in medical/hospitalist note set (outside these ortho notes).

4) NPWT indication
- Strength: operative note provides rationale: obesity + CKD + high infection risk.
- This is typically sufficient and supports coding for NPWT (<50 sq cm).

================================================================================
Section E — Suggested compliant CDI query list (record-grounded)

1) Pain score/character
- Query: Please document pain score (0–10) and pain character (sharp/dull, etc.) if assessed.

2) Fracture classification details
- Query: Please document fracture classification (Garden, if used) and any additional displacement/stability details from imaging.

3) Baseline function and living situation
- Query: Please document pre-injury functional status (ADLs/IADLs, assistive device use) and living situation/support.

4) PMH/PSH reconciliation
- Query: Please reconcile PMH/PSH sections to align with comorbidities referenced in HPI (HTN/HLD/CAD/CKD/anemia/aortic stenosis, etc.).

Bottom line
- AI recommendations are mostly reasonable, but several “missing” items are already documented (DJD rationale for THA; post-op plan including WBAT + Eliquis; NPWT rationale).
- Highest-yield remaining gaps: pain score/character, quantified social history, baseline function/living support, and formal Garden classification if required.
