We also discussed some of the risks specific to the anterior approach including\nnumbness over the lateral thigh, wound complications, and femoral component loosening or fracture of the femur.\nThese risks were discussed in the context of other approaches, specifically the posterior approach and its associated\nrisks. The patient expressed an understanding of these risks and the patient wished to proceed with a total hip\nreplacement.

The patient and family expressed understanding and elected\nto proceed with a total hip replacement.\n\nThe patient was seen by the Medicine service and was determined to be optimized from a medical standpoint for this\nsurgery. The medicine team cleared the patient for surgery as well.\n\nDescription of procedure:\nThe patient was seen in the preoperative holding area and the appropriate side lower extremity was marked. Again a\ndiscussion of the procedure was held with the patient and the patient wished to proceed.\n\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room and a preliminary anesthesia time out was then performed. General\nanesthesia was then performed by the anesthesia team. The patient was then placed supine on the operating room\ntable. Preoperative antibiotics were administered within thirty minutes of incision time as well as 1 gram of tranexamic\nacid. The patient was placed onto a sacral bump on the operating room table. At this point, the patient’s surgical area\nwas prepped and draped in the standard, sterile fashion. A surgical timeout was then performed to confirm the correct\nside, procedure, and name.\n\nA longitudinal incision was made starting lateral and distal to the anterior superior iliac spine. The incision was\ncarried down through the subcutaneous tissues down to the level of the tensor fascia lata. The tensor fascia lata was\nthen divided sharply with care not to violate the muscle below. Blunt dissection of the fascia was done to identify the\ninterval between the tensor fascia lata and the sartorius. Once this was done and deeper retractors had been placed,\nthe ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery was clearly visualized and this was cauterized. Next, the\nfat within this interval was dissected to better visualize the anterior hip capsule and the lateral border of the\niliocapsularis. At this point, a Cobb was used to elevate the iliocapsularis and rectus off the anterior capsule and a\nretractor was placed underneath these muscles. At this point, a capsulectomy was performed along the axis of the\nfemoral neck and the intertrochanteric ridge. A large hemarthrosis from the fracture was encountered. The retractors\nwere now placed intracapsular and the head-neck junction was exposed. A release of the pubofemoral ligament was\nthen performed until the lesser trochanter could be palpated. Using the pre-operative templating, the appropriate\nclean up neck cut was made and the femoral head and remaining neck was extracted.\n\nThe acetabulum was now visualized with the placement of retractors. At this point, the labrum and the contents of the\ncotyloid fossa were removed. The acetabulum was then reamed sequentially, based on preoperative templating.\nReaming was performed carefully. Next, the final size 50 acetabular component was impacted into the appropriate\nposition. The periphery of the acetabular component was inspected and any osteophytes were removed. Once this\nwas accomplished, the final 36mm neutral polyethylene liner was impacted into place. Care was taken to ensure that\nthe liner was fully seated and had engaged the locking mechanism.\n\nNext, the acetabular retractors were removed and attention was turned to the femur. The leg was positioned in an\nadducted and extended position. Retractors were then placed around the proximal femur to expose the cut neck\nsurface. Tight capsular tissue over the superior/anterior aspect of the femoral neck was released using cautery only\nto allow for sufficient exposure. A curved double footed retractor was placed over the greater trochanter laterally and\na femoral retractor placed at the infero medial neck. Sequential releases were performed in order to allow for\naccepted elevation of the femur, this was done in conjunction with gentle elevation with a bone hook.\n\nThe canal finder was then used to establish the IM canal. A box cutter was used to remove posterolateral bone of the\ncut neck. Arasp and curette were used to remove lateral femoral neck bone remaining. An entry broach was\nutilized, followed by sequential broaching up to the final size. With the broach left in place and after calcar planning,\nthe neck and trials were placed. The hip was reduced and found to be stable. Leg length, offset and implant size and\nposition were assessed clinically. Afterwards, the hip was dislocated. The trial components were removed.\n\nThe femoral canal was irrigated and a cement restrictor was placed down the canal. The canal was again rinsed and\ndried. Cement was then placed in the canal and pressurized, and the final size 1std stem was placed in the canal.\nAfter the cement hardened the actual 36mm +0 head was now impacted into place after cleaning and drying. The hip\nwas reduced with traction and internal rotation after confirming that the acetabular component was free of any debris\nand had been irrigated.\n\nThe wound was then copiously irrigated and washed with a dilute betadine solution then with normal saline. Copious\nirrigation was used throughout the closure. 1 gram of Vancomycin powder was placed in the deep wound. The\nfascia overlying the TFL was now closed using running barbed suture, with care to not entrap any of the lateral\nfemoral cutaneous nerve branches. The remainder of the wound was closed in layers using #1 Vicryl, 2-0 Vicryl, and\nstaples for skin. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy <50sq cm was used due to his obesity, ckd and high\nrisk for infection\n\nSN redapt/polarstem cemented components were used in this procedure.\n\nMondschein, Morris (MRN MR674177) Printed by Stagno, Cesarina [767] at 11/24/2025 8:20 AM 2/3\n\n11/24/25, 8:20 AM\n\nPostoperative Plan:\nWBAT: wbat\n\nPT/OT: OOB and ambulation\n\nMondschein, Morris (MR # MR674177) DOB: 03/27/1937\n\nPain control: Oxycodone 5mg as needed for moderate pain; Tylenol for mild pain\n\nDVT ppx: eliquis 2.5 bid 28 days\n\nPeriop ancef standing, 10 days cefadroxil 500 bid for high risk pji ppx\nColace 100mg BID while taking oxycodone\n\nKeep dressing clean and dry\n\nZofran PRN while taking oxycodone\n\nResume Home Medications\n\nMedical comanagement by hospitalist service, appreciate recommendations\n\nDispo: pending PT/OT eval\n\nMichael B Held, MD\n\nDate: 11/22/2025 Time: 8:08 AM\n\nElectronically signed by Held, Michael Brian, MD at 11/22/2025 11:04 AM\n\nED to Hosp-Admission (Current) on 11/20/2025\n\nRouting History\nPriority Sent On\n\nt 11/20/2025 7:43\nPM\n\nt 11/20/2025 6:28\nPM\n\nt 11/20/2025 6:17\nPM\n\nFrom\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nNote shared with patient\n\nTo\nNeuberth, Danielle Cornett, PA\n\nNeuberth, Danielle Cornett, PA\n\nNeuberth, Danielle Cornett, PA\n\nMondschein, Morris (MRN MR674177) Printed by Stagno, Cesarina [767] at 11/24/2025 8:20 AM\n\nMessage Type\nResults\n\nResults\n\nResults\n\n3/3\n=== END CHART: tmpaveiuo_8.pdf ===\n",

We discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to fixation as well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. After going over these options, we decided to pursue a left total hip replacement given his preexisting osteoarthritis of the left hip.\n\nWe discussed the risks of surgery including:\n- Infection, wound complications\n- Bleeding, need for a transfusion\n- Possible damage to surrounding neurovascular structures\n- Potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and worsening weakness\n- Stiffness, instability/dislocation\n- Limb length discrepancy\n- Fracture\n- Infection requiring resection or revision arthroplasty\n- Component loosening and the need for revision surgery in the future\n- Thromboembolic complications\n- Stroke, heart attack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary edema\n- Fat/cement embolus\n- Aspiration\n- Death\n- Risks of anesthesia and nerve blocks\n\nI specifically discussed his mortality rate of 30% in 1 year and possible need for dialysis given his CKD. His daughter and significant other witnessed the discussion and everyone verbalized understanding of the risks and benefits of surgical treatment. All of their questions were answered.\n\n### PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT\n- Pre-operative labs completed and potassium has been corrected\n- Acute kidney injury on known chronic kidney disease, appreciate medical consultation regarding risk stratification and clearance\n- NPO/IVF for OR in AM\n- Non-weight bearing left lower extremity\n- Pain control\n- DVT prophylaxis: on hold, no NSAIDs\n- Booked and consented for surgery\n\n[AI ADDED: Postoperative care plan]\n### POSTOPERATIVE CARE PLAN\n- [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: Specific weight-bearing status and timeline for progression]\n- [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: Planned postoperative DVT prophylaxis regimen]\n- [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: Anticipated rehabilitation protocol and disposition planning]\n- [NEEDS PHYSICIAN INPUT: Follow-up timeline and monitoring plan]\n\nMichael B Held, MD\n\nElectronically signed by Held, Michael Brian, MD at 11/22/2025 8:05 AM\n\nED to Hosp-Admission (Current) on 11/20/2025\n\nRouting History\n\nPriority\nt\nt\n\nSent On\n11/20/2025 7:43 PM\n11/20/2025 6:28 PM\n11/20/2025 6:17 PM\n\nFrom\nEdi, Rad Results In\nEdi, Rad Results In\nEdi, Rad Results In\n\nNote shared with",
