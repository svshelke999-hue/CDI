L449: Impression and plan:
L450: 
L451: Morris Mondschein is a 88 y.o. male sustained a left femoral neck hip fracture. Femur fractures in the elderly are of
L452: the highest severity due to the morbidity without treatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of
L453: ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications causing death. Therefore | had a long discussion with the
L454: patient and their family about the treatment options, including nonoperative and operative intervention. We
L455: discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to fixation as well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. After
L456: going over these options, we decided to pursue a left toal hip replacement given his preexisting osteoarthritis of the
L457: left hip.
L458: 
L459: We discussed the risks of surgery including infection, wound complications, bleeding, need for a transfusion, possible
L460: damage to surronding neurovascular structures, potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain
L461: and worsening weakness, stiffness, instability/dislocation, limb length discrepancy, fracture, infection requiring the
L462: resection or revision arthroplasty, component loosening and the need for revision surgery in the future. We also
L463: discussed the risks of thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart attack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary
L464: edema, fat/cement embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia and nerve blocks. | specifically discussed
L465: his mortality rate of 30% in 1 year and possible need for dialysis given his CKD. His daughter and significant other
L466: did witnessed the discuss and everyone verbalized understanding of the risks and benefits of surgical treatment. All
L467: of their questions were answered.
L468:

L593: Indication:
L594: 
L595: The patient is a 88 y.o. male who presented to our emergency room after a fall and was found to have a left hip
L596: displaced femoral neck fracture. Femur fractures in the elderly are of the highest severity due to the morbidity without
L597: treatment and risk of death due to bed-ridden disability, risk of ulcers, and risk of clot and other medical complications
L598: causing death. Therefore | had a long discussion with the patient and their family about the treatment options,
L599: including nonoperative and operative intervention. We discussed risks and benefits and alternatives to surgery as
L600: well as chances of full or partial weight bearing after. We discussed the risks of surgery including infection, wound
L601: complications, bleeding, need for a transfusion, possible damage to surronding neurovascular structures, potential for
L602: continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and worsening weakness, stiffness, instability/dislocation, limb
L603: length discrepancy, fracture, infection requiring the resection or revision arthroplasty, component loosening and the
L604: need for revision surgery in the future. We also discussed the risks of thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart
L605: attack, cardiac event, heart failure, pulmonary edema, fat embolus, aspiration, death, and the risks of anesthesia.
L606: The potential benefits of surgery are pain relief or improvement, improved mobility, and allowance of immediate
L607: weight bearing post-operatively. We also discussed some of the risks specific to the anterior approach including
L608: numbness over the lateral thigh, wound complications, and femoral component loosening or fracture of the femur.
L609: These risks were discussed in the context of other approaches, specifically the posterior approach and its associated
L610: risks. The patient expressed an understanding of these risks and the patient wished to proceed with a total hip
L611: replacement. We discussed his elevated risk of mortality, infection and needing dialysis due to his AKI on CKD.
L612: 
L613: We also discussed the overall poor prognosis for patients who have suffered a femur fracture, with high morbidity and

L621: The patient was seen by the Medicine service and was determined to be optimized from a medical standpoint for this
L622: surgery. The medicine team cleared the patient for surgery as well.
L623: 
L624: Description of procedure:
L625: The patient was seen in the preoperative holding area and the appropriate side lower extremity was marked. Again a
L626: discussion of the procedure was held with the patient and the patient wished to proceed.
L627: 
L628: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and a preliminary anesthesia time out was then performed. General
L629: anesthesia was then performed by the anesthesia team. The patient was then placed supine on the operating room
L630: table. Preoperative antibiotics were administered within thirty minutes of incision time as well as 1 gram of tranexamic
L631: acid. The patient was placed onto a sacral bump on the operating room table. At this point, the patient’s surgical area
L632: was prepped and draped in the standard, sterile fashion. A surgical timeout was then performed to confirm the correct
L633: side, procedure, and name.
L634: 
L635: A longitudinal incision was made starting lateral and distal to the anterior superior iliac spine. The incision was
L636: carried down through the subcutaneous tissues down to the level of the tensor fascia lata. The tensor fascia lata was
L637: then divided sharply with care not to violate the muscle below. Blunt dissection of the fascia was done to identify the
L638: interval between the tensor fascia lata and the sartorius. Once this was done and deeper retractors had been placed,
L639: the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery was clearly visualized and this was cauterized. Next, the
L640: fat within this interval was dissected to better visualize the anterior hip capsule and the lateral border of the
L641: iliocapsularis. At this point, a Cobb was used to elevate the iliocapsularis and rectus off the anterior capsule and a
L642: retractor was placed underneath these muscles. At this point, a capsulectomy was performed along the axis of the
L643: femoral neck and the intertrochanteric ridge. A large hemarthrosis from the fracture was encountered. The retractors
L644: were now placed intracapsular and the head-neck junction was exposed. A release of the pubofemoral ligament was
L645: then performed until the lesser trochanter could be palpated. Using the pre-operative templating, the appropriate
L646: clean up neck cut was made and the femoral head and remaining neck was extracted.
L647: 
L648: The acetabulum was now visualized with the placement of retractors. At this point, the labrum and the contents of the
L649: cotyloid fossa were removed. The acetabulum was then reamed sequentially, based on preoperative templating.
L650: Reaming was performed carefully. Next, the final size 50 acetabular component was impacted into the appropriate
L651: position. The periphery of the acetabular component was inspected and any osteophytes were removed. Once this
L652: was accomplished, the final 36mm neutral polyethylene liner was impacted into place. Care was taken to ensure that
L653: the liner was fully seated and had engaged the locking mechanism.
L654: 
L655: Next, the acetabular retractors were removed and attention was turned to the femur. The leg was positioned in an
L656: adducted and extended position. Retractors were then placed around the proximal femur to expose the cut neck
L657: surface. Tight capsular tissue over the superior/anterior aspect of the femoral neck was released using cautery only
L658: to allow for sufficient exposure. A curved double footed retractor was placed over the greater trochanter laterally and
L659: a femoral retractor placed at the infero medial neck. Sequential releases were performed in order to allow for
L660: accepted elevation of the femur, this was done in conjunction with gentle elevation with a bone hook.
L661: 
L662: The canal finder was then used to establish the IM canal. A box cutter was used to remove posterolateral bone of the
L663: cut neck. Arasp and curette were used to remove lateral femoral neck bone remaining. An entry broach was
L664: utilized, followed by sequential broaching up to the final size. With the broach left in place and after calcar planning,
L665: the neck and trials were placed. The hip was reduced and found to be stable. Leg length, offset and implant size and
L666: position were assessed clinically. Afterwards, the hip was dislocated. The trial components were removed.
L667: 
L668: The femoral canal was irrigated and a cement restrictor was placed down the canal. The canal was again rinsed and
L669: dried. Cement was then placed in the canal and pressurized, and the final size 1std stem was placed in the canal.
L670: After the cement hardened the actual 36mm +0 head was now impacted into place after cleaning and drying. The hip
L671: was reduced with traction and internal rotation after confirming that the acetabular component was free of any debris
L672: and had been irrigated.
L673: 
L674: The wound was then copiously irrigated and washed with a dilute betadine solution then with normal saline. Copious
L675: irrigation was used throughout the closure. 1 gram of Vancomycin powder was placed in the deep wound. The
L676: fascia overlying the TFL was now closed using running barbed suture, with care to not entrap any of the lateral
L677: femoral cutaneous nerve branches. The remainder of the wound was closed in layers using #1 Vicryl, 2-0 Vicryl, and
L678: staples for skin. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy <50sq cm was used due to his obesity, ckd and high
L679: risk for infection
L680: 
L681: SN redapt/polarstem cemented components were used in this procedure.
