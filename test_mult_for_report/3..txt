L128: [AI ADDED: MEDICAL NECESSITY DOCUMENTATION]
L129: Surgical intervention is medically necessary due to the presence of a displaced right intertrochanteric femur fracture causing severe pain, functional limitation, and inability to bear weight. Conservative management is not appropriate for this type of fracture due to high risk of displacement, nonunion, and complications from prolonged immobilization in an elderly patient. Surgical fixation will allow for earlier mobilization, reduced pain, and improved functional outcomes.
