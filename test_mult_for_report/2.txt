L021: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
L022: The patient is a 60 y.o. female with history of left total knee replacement performed in June 2025. The patient did well and was recovering quickly from her left knee replacement until recently. She has a history of lower extremity neuropathy leading to Charcot feet and has had numerous foot procedures to correct midfoot deformities.
L023: 
L024: Due to her Charcot foot arthropathy, she has been dealing with ulcerations and foot infections over the years. Recently, they had been well managed prior to the knee replacement. More recently, she began to have worsening of her foot issues; followed by Dr. Pao and wound care; she had infection and purulence, which was cultured and she was placed on antibiotics recently. Separately, she also had been on antibiotics for a UTI.
L025: 
L026: days ago, she had acute onset of left knee pain and severe swelling. Prior to this she was doing well with the knee replacement surgery. This was progressive and painful and she had a large effusion. She was sent to the GH ED yesterday where she had elevated inflammatory markers, the knee was aspirated and was consistent with acute infection with a highly inflammatory white blood cell count, and there was a positive culture.
L027: 
L028: She was admitted and IV antibiotics were initiated after the organism was identified. Dr. Rossi from ID was consulted.
