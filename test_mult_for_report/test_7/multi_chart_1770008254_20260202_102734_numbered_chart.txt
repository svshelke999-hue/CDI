L344: Indication:
L345: 
L346: The patient is a 86 y.o. male who was brought to Greenwich Hospital Emergency Department after a mechanical fall
L347: after which the patient was unable to bear weight. X rays in the emergency room demonstrated evidence of a
L348: displaced femoral fracture. Given the nature of the injury, a discussion regarding the risks associated with and the
L349: alternatives to surgery were discussed. This discussion included the potential complications of deep venous
L350: thrombosis, infection, nerve or blood vessel injury, ligament injury, dislocation, leg length discrepancy, fracture, mal-
L351: or non-union, and incomplete resolution of pain, the patient wished to proceed with open reduction internal fixation of
L352: the intertrochanteric femur.
L353: 
L354: Procedure:
L355: 
L356: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful induction of general/LMA anesthesia, a
L357: closed reduction was performed. Flouroscopy was used to confirm that the reduction was within acceptable
L358:

L362: 
L363: parameters.The lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with the patient in the
L364: supine position on the fracture table. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered within 30 minutes prior to the
L365: procedure as well as 1 gram of tranexamic acid. A time out was performed by all members of the surgical team
L366: confirming patient identity and surgical site laterality.
L367: 
L368: A lateral incision was made proximal to, and in-line with, the femur. The entry guidewire was then advanced onto the
L369: appropriate start site on the greater trochanter. This was confirmed with intraoperative flouroscopy on both the AP
L370: and lateral views. The guidewire was then advanced with power into the intramedullary canal. Again flouroscopy was
L371: used to confirm that the entry guidewire was in the appropriate position. The entry reamer was then used through the
L372: soft tissue protector canula. Flouroscopy was used to confirm appropriate position of the entry reamer within the
L373: intramedullary canal and that it had been advanced to a sufficient depth. The reamer and entry guidewire were then
L374: removed.
L375: 
L376: The nail was then carefully advanced over the guidewire. During advancement of the nail, all reduction maneuvers
L377: were employed to maintain the reduction during insertion of the nail. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the
L378: nail had been advanced to the appropriate depth. The long guidewire was then removed. An incision was made over
L379: the lateral aspect of the thigh and the cannula for the lag screw was advanced until it made contact with the lateral
L380: cortical bone. Using flouroscopic guidance, the guidewire for the lag screw was then inserted and confirmed to be in
L381: appropriate position with the guidwire center-center on AP and lateral views of the femoral head. The depth of the
L382: guidewire was then measured and the 105 mm lag screw selected. The guidewire was then overdrilled and tapped
L383: for the screw of the appropriate depth. The lag screw was then inserted to the appropriate depth which again
L384: confirmed using flouroscopy. Similarly the anti rotation screw also placed in the standard fashion.
L385: 
L386: We then turned our attention to insertion of the distal interlocking screws. Two small incisions made over the lateral
L387: thigh in line with the cannula for the distal interlocking screw. The cannula was then advanced through the incision
L388: and down to bone. The drill was then carefully advanced and the depth of the interlocking screw measured off of the
L389: drill. The screws of appropriate length was then inserted. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the screws
L390: were in appropriate position.
L391: 
L392: The wounds were then copiously irrigated. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl suture. The deep
L393: subcutaneous layers were closed with interrupted 0 vicryl and the dermal layer with 3-0 vicryl. The skin was then
L394: closed with staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and the patient was awaken from anesthesia. The patient
L395: was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. All sponge and instrument counts were correct.
L396: 
L397: Postop Plan
L398: 
L399: The patient will be partial weight bearing (50% weight bearing for 6 weeks). DVT prophylaxis will be started on
L400: POD1; additional DVT prophylaxis will include SCDs, compression stockings, progressive mobilization. They will
L401: receive 24 hours of postoperative antibiotics. The patient will be discharged from the hospital when they are
L402: medically stable, have met all PT goals, and their pain is well controlled with oral analgesia.
