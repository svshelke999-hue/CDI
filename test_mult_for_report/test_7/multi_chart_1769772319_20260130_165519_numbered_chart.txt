L180: Mr. Ipekdjian is an 82 y.o. male with HTN, Dementia, DM2, multinodular goiter, frequent falls causing traumatic
L181: SDH + SAH and skull fracture (9/2024), nephrolithiasis s/p left ureteral stent placement who presents with a R
L182: unstable IT Fx.
L183: 
L184: | had a very long and thorough discussion with the patient's cousin Paul, who is his healthcare proxy, regarding this
L185: injury and its treatment options. Given the patient's previous functional status, goals, and injury, | did present surgical
L186: intervention as an option to treat this injury. Surgical intervention would take the form of a hip cephalomedullary nail.
L187: The patient understands that conservative treatment for this injury is an option, and would consist of
L188: nonweightbearing of the injured lower extremity for approximately 6 weeks while the fracture heals. They understand
L189: that conservative treatment is associated with higher risks of nonunion, malunion, prolonged immobility, the sequelae
L190: of prolonged immobility such as ulcers and blood clots, and increased pain. They also understand that the risks
L191: associated with surgery, which are described below, are not present with nonoperative treatment. They do
L192: understand that surgery would allow for near immediate mobilization with physical therapy. | made it clear that
L193: nonoperative treatment of hip fractures is typically associated with an approximately 89% mortality rate at 1 year.
L194: 
L195: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery were discussed at length with the patient's cousin Paul, who is his
L196: healthcare proxy, today over the phone. Risks discussed include but are not limited to bleeding, infection,
L197: neurovascular injury, anesthesia risks, wound healing problems, failure to alleviate pain, new pain, stiffness,
L198: nonunion, malunion, symptomatic hardware, hardware failure, arthritis, recurrent deformity, recurrent instability,
L199: inability to return to previous level of activity, medical complications, the need for more surgery in the future, loss of
L200: limb, and loss of life. Specifically, complications and loss of life is a significant risk of undergoing this procedure. The
L201: patient's cousin understood this. No guarantees were given. All questions were answered. After this discussion, the
L202: patient's cousin Paul , who is his healthcare proxy, chose to proceed with surgical intervention.

L385: right lower extremity, was marked.
L386: 
L387: The patient was brought to the operating room. General anesthesia was administered. The patient was transferred
L388: supine to the Hana table. All bony prominences were well padded. A well-padded perineal post was placed. The feet
L389: and ankles were wrapped in Webril and Coban and placed into traction boots. The operative lower extremity was

L394: 
L395: placed into straight longitudinal alignment and slight adduction. The contralateral lower extremity was also placed
L396: into straight longitudinal alignment, in slight abduction and hip extension to facilitate obtaining fluoroscopic images of
L397: the operative extremity. The fracture site was identified and reduced into a satisfactory, reduced position on both AP
L398: and lateral fluoroscopic images. Consistent with preoperative imaging, there was comminution of both the greater
L399: and lesser trochanters. The operative extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with a
L400: chlorhexidine scrub brush followed by chlorhexidine surgical prep. Appropriate time was given for the prep to dry,
L401: and appropriate antibiotics were given within 1 hour of the start of the procedure. Surgical time-out was performed.
L402: 
L403: The longitudinal axis of the femur as well as the level of the greater trochanter were marked on the sterile drape. An
L404: incision approximately % of an inch in length was made about 2 fingerbreadths proximal to the tip of the greater
L405: trochanter as demonstrated fluoroscopically. Dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissue along the line
L406: of the incision. The fascia was then opened in line with the incision but distal to the incision. The greater trochanter
L407: was able to be palpated manually at this point. A guidewire was used to establish the correct trajectory down the tip
L408: of the greater trochanter in line with the proximal metaphysis of the femur. Correct position of this wire was verified
L409: using orthogonal fluoroscopic views. The opening Reamer was utilized. A 3.0 mm ball-tipped guidewire was then
L410: placed down the femoral canal to the level of the physeal scar. Appropriate position of this wire distally was
L411: confirmed using orthogonal fluoroscopic views. A depth gauge was used to measure the appropriate length of the
L412: nail.
L413: 
L414: The nail was then inserted into the femoral canal with the jig facing anterior, and then gradually being lowered into
L415: the lateral position as the nail progressed to match the bow of the femur. The nail was inserted to appropriate depth
L416: as confirmed on fluoroscopic imaging. Next, a separate stab incision was made for another guidewire to be placed
L417: through a triple sleeve into approximately the center center position of the femoral head. A depth gauge was inserted
L418: to the level of bone to ascertain the appropriate length of lag screw.
L419: 
L420: Given the extensive comminution of the fracture, so a derotation screw was placed into the femoral head through the
L421: jig superior to the lag screw guidewire for extra fixation. The lag screw incision was extended proximally, and the
L422: derotation trocar was placed. A drill was then used to drill for the derotation screw, and then the screw was inserted.
L423: 
L424: The lag screw guidewire was then over-reamed, with care taken to not enter into the hip joint itself.
L425: 
L426: The lag screw was then inserted over its guidewire. Traction was then removed from the operative extremity and
L427: compression of the fracture was performed utilizing the compression sleeve on the jig. Appropriate compression of
L428: the fracture was confirmed using fluoroscopy.
L429: 
L430: Following this, the derotation screw was then final tightened, as fracture compression resulted in the derotation screw
L431: becoming slightly proud.
L432: 
L433: Then one distal interlock screw was placed into the nail in the static hole. Perfect circle technique was used to place
L434: this distal interlock as follows: a perfect lateral of the distal end of the nail was obtained. An incision was made in the
L435: center of the static hole. A clamp was used to spread bluntly to bone in both planes. A drill bit was positioned so that
L436: the tip was in the center of the hole, confirmed using two fluoroscopic views in which the drill bit was positioned in
L437: orthogonal planes with respect to the xray beam. The drill was then positioned in line with the C-arm and drilled
L438: across the near femoral cortex, through the nail, and just past the far femoral cortex. The screw length was then
L439: measured off of the drill bit. The drill was removed and the screw inserted with appropriate purchase obtained as the
L440: screw was seated down to bone.
L441: 
L442: Next, orthogonal fluoroscopic views demonstrated appropriate position of the distal interlock screw, the fracture, the
L443: proximal nail, and the lag screw. At this point, the procedure was accepted.
L444: 
L445: All incisions were washed out with copious sterile normal saline from a bulb syringe. The proximal wound underwent
L446: a layered fashion closure, with 0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures to close the fascia, 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue,
L447: and staples for skin. The other incisions were closed with 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue and staples for skin.
L448: RECK solution was injected around the skin incisions for pain relief. Dermabond was then placed over the wounds.
L449: Sterile dressings were applied. The patient was then awoken from anesthesia and transferred off the operating room
L450: table in stable condition. Final counts were correct.
