L368: Plan:
L369: 
L370: A careful discussion of the risks and benefits of the surgery was held with the patient including infection, bleeding,
L371: damage to neurovascular structures and potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and
L372: 
L373: worsening weakness, stiffness, stability, limb length discrepancy, fracture, infection and the need for revision surgery
L374: 
L375: in the future, DVT prophylaxis and the risks for anesthetic complications and pulmonary complications and even
L376: death. The patient expressed an understanding of these risks and the patient wished to proceed with surgery.
L377: 
L378: Discussed the injury pattern, expected outcomes and r/b/a of surgical and non surgical management.
L379: Given that she is independently mobilizing, we discussed that non operative management would be
L380: 
L381: inappropriate. Surgical fixation would entail right hip ORIF

L483: The patient is a 81 y.o. female who was brought to Greenwich Hospital Emergency Department after a mechanical fall 
L484: after which the patient was unable to bear weight. X rays in the emergency room demonstrated evidence of a displaced 
L485: femoral fracture. Given the nature of the injury, a discussion regarding the risks associated with and the alternatives to 
L486: surgery were discussed. This discussion included the potential complications of deep venous thrombosis, infection, nerve 
L487: or blood vessel injury, ligament injury, dislocation, leg length discrepancy, fracture, mal- or non-union, and incomplete 
L488: resolution of pain, the patient wished to proceed with open reduction and intramedullary nailing of the femur.

L493: Procedure: 
L494: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful induction of spinal anesthesia, a closed 
L495: reduction was performed. Flouroscopy was used to confirm that the reduction was within acceptable parameters. The 
L496: lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with the patient in the supine position on the 
L497: fracture table. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered within 30 minutes prior to the procedure as well as 1 gram of 
L498: tranexamic acid. A time out was performed by all members of the surgical team confirming patient identity and surgical 
L499: site laterality. 
L500: A lateral incision was made proximal to, and in-line with, the femur. The entry guidewire was then advanced onto the 
L501: appropriate start site on the greater trochanter. This was confirmed with intraoperative flouroscopy on both the AP and 
L502: lateral views. The guidewire was then advanced with power into the intramedullary canal. Again flouroscopy was used to 
L503: confirm that the entry guidewire was in the appropriate position. The entry reamer was then used through the soft tissue 
L504: protector canula. Flouroscopy was used to confirm appropriate position of the entry reamer within the intramedullary canal 
L505: and that it had been advanced to a sufficient depth. The reamer and entry guidewire were then removed. 
L506: The nail was then carefully advanced over the guidewire. During advancement of the nail, all reduction maneuvers were 
L507: employed to maintain the reduction during insertion of the nail. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the nail had 
L508: been advanced to the appropriate depth. The long guidewire was then removed. An incision was made over the lateral 
L509: aspect of the thigh and the cannula for the lag screw was advanced until it made contact with the lateral cortical bone. 
L510: Using flouroscopic guidance, the guidewire for the lag screw was then inserted and confirmed to be in appropriate position 
L511: with the guidwire center-center on AP and lateral views of the femoral head. The depth of the guidewire was then 
L512: measured and the 95 mm lag screw selected. The guidewire was then overdrilled and tapped for the screw of the 
L513: appropriate depth. The lag screw was then inserted to the appropriate depth which again confirmed using flouroscopy. 
L514: We then turned our attention to insertion of the distal interlocking screw. A small incision was made over the lateral thigh 
L515: in line with the cannula for the distal interlocking screw. The cannula was then advanced through the incision and down to 
L516: bone. The drill was then carefully advanced and the depth of the interlocking screw measured off of the drill. The screw of 
L517: appropriate length was then inserted. Flouroscopy was again used to confirm that the screws were in appropriate position. 
L518: The wounds were then copiously irrigated. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 vicryl suture. The deep subcutaneous 
L519: layers were closed with interrupted 0 vicryl and the dermal layer with 3-0 vicryl. The skin was then closed with staples. 
L520: Sterile dressings were then applied and the patient was awaken from anesthesia. The patient was transferred to the 
L521: recovery room in stable condition. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. 
L522: Postop Plan 
L523: The patient will be WBAT (protected weight bearing with a walker). DVT prophylaxis will be started with aspirin starting 
L524: POD1 additional DVT prophylaxis will include SCDs, compression stockings, progressive mobilization. They will receive 
L525: 24 hours of postoperative antibiotics. The patient will be discharged from the hospital when they are medically stable, 
L526: have met all PT goals, and their pain is well controlled with oral analgesia.
