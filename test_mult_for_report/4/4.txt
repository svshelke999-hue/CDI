L122: [AI ADDED: MEDICAL DECISION MAKING]
L123: I had a very long and thorough discussion with the patient's cousin Paul, who is his healthcare proxy, regarding this injury. I did present surgical intervention as an option to treat this injury. Surgical intervention would take the form of a hip cephalomedullary nail. The patient understands that conservative treatment for this injury is an option, and would consist of nonweightbearing of the injured lower extremity for approximately 6 weeks while the fracture heals. They understand that conservative treatment is associated with higher risks of nonunion, malunion, prolonged immobility, the sequelae of prolonged immobility such as ulcers and blood clots, and increased pain. They also understand that the risks associated with surgery, which are described below, are not present with nonoperative treatment. They do understand that nonoperative treatment of hip fractures is typically associated with an approximately 89% mortality rate at 1 year.
L124: 
L125: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery were discussed at length with the patient's cousin Paul, who is his healthcare proxy, today over the phone. Risks discussed include but are not limited to bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, anesthesia risks, wound healing problems, failure to alleviate pain, new pain, stiffness, nonunion, malunion, symptomatic hardware, hardware failure, arthritis, recurrent deformity, recurrent instability, inability to return to previous level of activity, medical complications, the need for more surgery in the future, loss of limb, and loss of life. Specifically, complications and loss of life is a significant risk of undergoing this procedure. The patient's cousin understood this. No guarantees were given. All questions were answered. After this discussion, the patient's cousin Paul, who is his healthcare proxy, chose to proceed with surgical intervention.
