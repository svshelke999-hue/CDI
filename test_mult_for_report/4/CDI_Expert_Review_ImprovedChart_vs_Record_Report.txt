CDI Expert Review Report (AI “Improved Chart” vs Medical Record Evidence)
Folder: test_mult_for_report/4
Prepared: 2026-02-02

Scope / Files Reviewed
- 1) 4.txt (AI “improved” orthopedic H&P with AI-added sections + physician-input placeholders)
- 2) multi_chart_1769772319_20260130_165519_numbered_chart.txt (raw medical record text: admission note + operative note)
- 3) multi_chart_1769772319_20260130_165519.json (raw AI output with structured “improvements”, “user_input_required”, “recommendations”)

Case synopsis (record-based)
- 82-year-old male from skilled nursing facility (Nathaniel Witherall ECF) with dementia/DM2/HTN and significant fall history.
- Presents after unwitnessed fall with head strike in shower → right hip pain and inability to bear weight.
- Imaging impression: “R unstable intertrochanteric fracture.”
- Treatment: right hip cephalomedullary nail fixation on 1/4/2026; operative note documents extensive comminution (greater + lesser trochanters), ASA class 3, post-op WBAT, DVT prophylaxis, and PT/OT plan.

Method (how the “test” was done)
- Extracted AI-added changes and “needs physician input” items from:
  - 4.txt tags: [AI ADDED], [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED]
  - JSON: enhanced_by_ai.improvements, enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required, enhanced_by_ai.recommendations
- Cross-checked each AI/physician suggestion against the raw record to label:
  - PRESENT (already documented),
  - PARTIAL (some elements present but incomplete),
  - MISSING (not found / needs clarification).

Key CDI finding (high-signal)
- The raw record already contains many elements the improved chart flags as missing, especially in the operative note:
  - ASA class, implant details, intra-op fracture comminution description, post-op WB status, DVT prophylaxis duration, and PT/OT activity orders.
- True remaining gaps are largely: standardized pain score/quality/radiation/relief, reconciled home medication list, and explicit listing of vital signs and labs (the admission note states they were “reviewed” but does not show values).

================================================================================
Section A — “AI Added” improvements (what the AI changed/added)
Source: JSON → enhanced_by_ai.improvements (and visible in 4.txt / JSON improved_chart_by_ai)

1) Structure / headers / organized PMH/PSH/social history
- AI-added: reorganized note into payer-friendly sections.
- Evidence check: NOT APPLICABLE (formatting).

2) “Diabetes mellitus type 2 with documented hyperglycemia”
- AI-added: specified hyperglycemia.
- Evidence check: PRESENT (raw record lists “Diabetes with hyperglycemia” as a secondary diagnosis during hospitalization).

3) Expanded neurovascular status sentence
- AI-added: “distal pulses intact… motor intact except limited by pain.”
- Evidence check: PRESENT IN SUBSTANCE (raw admission note documents SILT distributions, motor function, BCR/WWP).

4) Added clinical impression including ICD-10
- AI-added: ICD-10 (e.g., S72.141) and “non-ambulatory/in significant pain requiring surgery”.
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: unstable intertrochanteric fracture; inability to bear weight; significant pain; plan for surgery.
  - CAUTION: ICD-10 and “non-ambulatory” should be validated—record documents inability to bear weight currently; baseline ambulatory status is not explicitly described in the provided text.

5) Added “comprehensive post-op plan” block (PT/OT timeline, 2-week f/u, discharge to SNF)
- AI-added: detailed post-op plan language.
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: operative note includes PT/OT “oob and ambulation” and disposition pending PT/OT eval; patient is already SNF resident.
  - MISSING/UNCLEAR: fixed follow-up intervals (2 weeks, 6 weeks) are not documented in the raw record excerpts.

================================================================================
Section B — Physician-input suggestions (AI prompts) + evidence check
Sources:
- 4.txt placeholders [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: …]
- JSON enhanced_by_ai.user_input_required

1) Pain severity (0–10) + pain quality/radiation/relieving factors
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: MISSING (pain described as worse with ROM; no 0–10 score/quality/radiation/relief documented in provided text).

2) Complete home medication list (dose/frequency)
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: MISSING IN PROVIDED TEXT (admission note says “Prior to Admission Medications … (Not in a hospital admission)” and “Resume Home Medications” without listing).

3) Standardized mental status assessment tool
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: “awake, alert but confused” and dementia is listed; history is limited by condition.
  - MISSING: standardized score/tool (e.g., orientation detail, CAM, MMSE/MoCA) in these excerpts.

4) Specific radiographic findings (pattern/displacement/comminution)
- AI prompt priority: HIGH
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: “Right unstable IT fracture” on x-ray; operative note documents comminution of both greater and lesser trochanters and “unstable intertrochanteric fracture.”
  - MISSING: formal fracture classification (AO/OTA) and explicit displacement descriptors in the provided admission note.

5) Specific lab values (CBC/BMP/coags) and specific vital signs
- AI prompt priority: MEDIUM
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: note states vitals and labs were reviewed; pre-op labs (CBC/BMP/coags/T&S/CXR/EKG) “completed.”
  - MISSING: the actual numeric values are not shown in the provided raw text.

================================================================================
Section C — AI recommendations (JSON recommendations array) + evidence check

1) Document specific pain severity (0–10) (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: MISSING.

2) Document detailed radiographic findings supporting surgery (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (unstable IT fracture + comminution are present; classification/displacement details incomplete).

3) Explicitly document why conservative care is not appropriate (Priority: HIGH)
- Evidence check: PRESENT (raw admission note includes strong discussion re nonoperative risks, prolonged immobility sequelae, and cites high 1-year mortality; operative note repeats this narrative).

4) Document baseline functional status prior to injury (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL
  - PRESENT: “history provided by nursing home,” SNF resident, and “difficulty walking” diagnosis exists.
  - MISSING: explicit baseline mobility/assistive device/transfer status in the provided text.
  - CDI note: the AI-generated statement “requires walker for ambulation” appears in JSON improved chart but is not clearly supported by the raw excerpts shown; treat as UNVERIFIED unless present elsewhere in chart.

5) Document rehab plan intensity/duration (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Evidence check: PARTIAL (PT/OT “oob and ambulation” and dispo pending PT/OT documented; duration/intensity not specified).

================================================================================
Section D — CDI expert opinion: additional opportunities (case-specific)

1) Laterality consistency + fracture characterization
- Opportunity: ensure “right” laterality and “unstable intertrochanteric” terminology remains consistent across H&P and op note; add AO/OTA classification if used.

2) Fall + head strike evaluation documentation
- Observation: unwitnessed fall with head strike; patient has prior traumatic SDH/SAH/skull fracture history.
- Opportunity: ensure head-injury evaluation/imaging and neuro checks are documented in the appropriate service note set (may be outside ortho note).

3) Comorbidity specificity
- Opportunity: clarify DM2 status (controlled vs uncontrolled) and whether hyperglycemia required treatment adjustments; document periop management impact where applicable.

4) Baseline function / SNF level of care
- Opportunity: document baseline ambulatory status (wheelchair vs walker vs independent), transfers, and ADLs—important for medical necessity, discharge planning, and expected outcomes.

================================================================================
Section E — Suggested compliant CDI query list (record-grounded)

1) Pain assessment
- Query: Please document pain severity score (0–10), and pain quality/radiation/relieving factors if assessed.

2) Fracture classification/details
- Query: Please document fracture classification (AO/OTA if used) and key radiographic features (displacement/comminution/stability).

3) Baseline function
- Query: Please document baseline mobility and assistive device use (SNF baseline), transfers, and ADL status prior to fall.

4) Home medication reconciliation
- Query: Please include reconciled home medication list with dose/frequency (or reference where documented).

5) Vitals/labs in the note (if required by local payer/compliance expectations)
- Query: Please include key pre-op vitals and lab values (CBC/BMP/coags) or reference exact results in the record.

Bottom line
- AI-added improvements mainly improve structure and highlight payer-friendly documentation points.
- Many prompts are already satisfied by the record (especially operative note: ASA 3, implants, comminution, WBAT, DVT plan).
- Highest-yield remaining gaps: pain score/details, baseline functional status, home med list, and explicit lab/vital values in the narrative.
