L091: GENERAL: The patient is well-appearing, alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress, cooperative with examination.
L092: RESPIRATORY: Breathing comfortable without excessive work of breathing.
L093: HEENT: Sclera anicteric.

L096: 
L097: FOCUSED EXAMINATION - LEFT FEMUR:
L098: Range of motion deferred.
L099: Left lower extremity is shortened and externally rotated. [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: Specific measurements of limb length discrepancy, degree of external rotation, and presence of any ecchymosis or deformity]
L100: 
L101: [AI ADDED: Formatted section header] DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
L102: XR and CT of the left hip demonstrate severely comminuted and angulated left proximal intertrochanteric femoral fracture. [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: Specific fracture classification (e.g., AO/OTA classification) and any additional imaging findings relevant to surgical planning]
L103: 
L104: [AI ADDED: Formatted section header] IMPRESSION:
L105: . Severely comminuted left intertrochanteric femoral fracture
L106: . 86-year-old with serious medical comorbidities including:
L107:    - Coronary artery disease status post stent placement on Plavix (currently held)
L108:    - Atrial fibrillation
L109:    - Recent left inguinal hernia repair (10/2025)
L110:    - History of TIA (2021)
L111:    - Venous insufficiency with chronic lower extremity wounds
L112: 
L113: [AI ADDED: Formatted section header] ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
L114: Patient is optimized, advised by PCP and Cardiology to proceed with surgical intervention if remains stable.
L115: 
L116: Discussed with the patient and son the high-risk nature of this surgery, particularly given his frailty and medical comorbidities. There is a chance of serious medical complication and possibly death.
L117: 
L118: We discussed non-operative and operative options. Given that he was walking prior to the fall, it is within their goals of care to undergo operative fixation of this injury, acknowledging the non-modifiable high-risk nature.
L119: 
L120: [AI ADDED: Specific surgical plan] SURGICAL PLAN: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of left intertrochanteric femoral fracture [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: Specific implant planned (e.g., cephalomedullary nail, sliding hip screw, or other device)]
L121: 
L122: [AI ADDED: Medical necessity documentation] MEDICAL NECESSITY DOCUMENTATION:
L123: - Patient has an acute, severely comminuted left intertrochanteric femoral fracture confirmed by imaging
L124: - Patient was ambulatory prior to injury
L125: - Non-operative management would likely result in prolonged immobility, pain, and functional decline
L126: - Surgical fixation is indicated to restore mobility, reduce pain, and prevent complications of prolonged immobilization
L127: 
L128: [AI ADDED: Risk assessment] PERIOPERATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT:
L129: - Cardiac: History of CAD with stents, A-fib - [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: Current cardiac clearance status and any specific cardiac precautions]
L130: - Bleeding risk: On Plavix (currently held) - [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: Plan for perioperative anticoagulation management]
L131: - Infection risk: History of multiple infections including ESBL - [⚠️ PHYSICIAN INPUT REQUIRED: Specific perioperative antibiotic plan]
L132: 
L133: All questions answered.
L134: 
L135: A careful discussion of the risks and benefits of the surgery was held with the patient including infection, bleeding, damage to neurovascular structures and potential for continued pain, continued weakness, worsening pain and worsening weakness, stiffness, stability, limb length discrepancy, fracture, infection and the need for revision surgery in the future, DVT prophylaxis and the risks for anesthetic complications and pulmonary complications and even death. The patient expressed an understanding of these risks and the patient wished to proceed with surgery.
