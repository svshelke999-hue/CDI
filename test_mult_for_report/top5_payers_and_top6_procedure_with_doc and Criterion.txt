- Proper documentation should include appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes that support medical necessity for total hip arthroplasty as referenced in LCA A59811, A57765, and other billing and coding articles
- Since multiple billing and coding articles are referenced (A57683, A57684, A59811, A56777, A57765), it can be inferred that proper documentation of the procedure, including operative notes, pre-operative evaluations, and post-operative care plans, would be required
- As CPT 27130 appears to be classified as an inpatient-only procedure, documentation would need to support the inpatient setting for the procedure
- Documentation would likely need to include:
  * History and physical examination findings
  * Diagnostic imaging results demonstrating hip pathology
  * Conservative treatment attempts and outcomes (if applicable)
  * Surgical indications
  * Operative report detailing the total hip arthroplasty procedure
  * Post-operative care plan

- LCA A59811 states that specific ICD-10-CM codes support medical necessity for Total Hip Arthroplasty CPT code 27130
- LCA A57765 also indicates that certain ICD-10-CM codes support medical necessity for Total Hip Arthroplasty CPT code 27130
- While the specific ICD-10-CM codes are not fully listed in the provided content, these codes would typically represent conditions that justify the medical necessity for total hip arthroplasty, such as:
  * Advanced degenerative joint disease
  * Avascular necrosis
  * Hip fractures
  * Failed previous hip surgeries
  * Other hip pathologies requiring total joint replacement
- The LCD L36573 specifically addresses "medical necessity criteria for performing total hip replacement surgery," indicating that Medicare coverage for CPT 27130 is subject to specific medical necessity requirements
- Multiple billing and coding articles (A57683, A57684, A59811, A56777, A57765) complement the LCD and provide guidance on proper billing and coding for total hip arthroplasty, suggesting that proper documentation of medical necessity through appropriate diagnosis codes is essential for coverage

  clinical criteria for coverage but does not guarantee coverage of the service requested
- Documentation should include:
  * History and physical examination findings
  * Description of functional limitations
  * Results of diagnostic imaging confirming rotator cuff tear
  * Documentation of failed conservative treatment

  * For cases requiring extensive debridement (29823) in addition to rotator cuff repair 
    (29827), documentation must clearly indicate that the debridement was performed in a 
    different area of the same shoulder

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION:
- Varies by specific plan
- When prior authorization is required, the following information should be submitted:

CPT 73721 - MRI LOWER EXTREMITY (NO CONTRAST)
================================================================================

COVERAGE CRITERIA:

For Commercial Plans:
- An MRI of the lower extremity joint without contrast (CPT 73721) in the hospital outpatient 
  department is considered medically necessary for individuals who meet any of the following 
  criteria:
  * Are participating in a clinical trial that requires a specific imaging protocol or 
    equipment not available in a freestanding facility
  * Are scheduled for the MRI within 24 hours of a hospital specialist appointment at the 
    same hospital-based facility where the procedure is requested
  * Have a known allergy to a contrast agent used for the procedure
  * Have a known chronic disease undergoing active treatment, when direct comparison to 
    prior studies requires the same imaging protocol or equipment obtained at the same 
    hospital-based facility where the procedure is requested
  * Have a systemic cancer on active treatment, when restaging studies require the same 
    imaging protocol or equipment used for prior studies obtained at the same hospital-based 
    facility where the procedure is requested
  * Pre-procedure imaging which is done within 24 hours of the interventional or surgical 
    procedure and is an integral part of the planned procedure
  * Require obstetrical observation
  * Require perinatology services
  * Under 18 years of age
- An MRI of the lower extremity joint without contrast (CPT 73721) in the hospital outpatient 
  department is also considered medically necessary when there are no geographically accessible 
  appropriate alternative sites for the individual to undergo the procedure, including but not 
  limited to the following:
  * Moderate or deep sedation or general anesthesia is required for the procedure and a 
    freestanding facility providing such sedation is not available; or
  * The equipment for the size of the individual is not available; or
  * Open MRI is required because the member has a documented diagnosis of claustrophobia and/or 
    severe anxiety which is not available in a freestanding facility
- An MRI of the lower extremity joint without contrast (CPT 73721) in the hospital outpatient 
  department is considered medically necessary when imaging in a physician's office or 
  freestanding imaging center would reasonably be expected to delay care and adversely impact 
  health outcome
- Specific clinical indications include (but not limited to):
  * For evaluation of suspected fracture when x-rays are negative or equivocal and there is 
    clinical suspicion for fracture

    or equivocal
  * For evaluation of suspected bone or soft tissue tumor or mass
  * For evaluation of known bone or soft tissue tumor or mass for treatment planning or follow-up
  * For evaluation of suspected slipped capital femoral epiphysis
  * For evaluation of suspected inflammatory arthritis when x-rays are negative or equivocal
